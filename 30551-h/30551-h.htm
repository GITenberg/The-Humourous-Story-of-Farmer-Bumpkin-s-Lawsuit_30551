<p>Considering the enormous interest which the Public have in
&ldquo;a more efficient and speedy administration of
justice,&rdquo; I am not surprised that a Second Edition of
&ldquo;Mr. Bumpkin&rsquo;s Lawsuit&rdquo; should be called for so
soon after the publication of the first.&nbsp; If any proof were
wanting that I had not overstated the evils attendant on the
present system, it would be found in the case of
<i>Smitherman</i> v. <i>The South Eastern Railway Company</i>,
which came before the House of Lords recently; and judgment in
which was delivered on the 16th of July, 1883.&nbsp; The facts of
the case were extremely simple, and were as follow:&mdash;A man
of the name of Smitherman was killed on a level crossing of <!--
page vi--><a name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vi</span>the South Eastern Railway Company at East Farleigh, in
December, 1878.&nbsp; His widow, on behalf of herself and four
children, brought an action against the Company on the ground of
negligence on the part of the defendants.&nbsp; The case in due
course was tried at the Maidstone Assizes, and the plaintiff
obtained a verdict for &pound;400 for herself and &pound;125 for
each of the children.&nbsp; A rule for a new trial was granted by
the Divisional Court: the rule for the new trial was discharged
by the Court of Appeal.&nbsp; The Lords reversed the decision of
the Court of Appeal, and ordered a new trial.&nbsp; New trial
took place at Guildhall, City of London, before Mr. Baron
Pollock; jury again found for the plaintiff, with &pound;700
<i>agreed</i> damages: Company thereby saving &pound;200.&nbsp;
Once more rule for new trial granted by Divisional Court: once
more rule discharged by Court of Appeal: once more House of Lords
reverse decision of Court of Appeal, and order <i>second new
trial</i>.&nbsp; So <!-- page vii--><a name="pagevii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. vii</span>that after more than four years of
harassing litigation, this poor widow and her children are left
in the same position that they were in immediately after the
accident&mdash;except that they are so much the worse as being
liable for an amount of costs which need not be calculated.&nbsp;
The case was tried by competent judges and special juries; and
yet, by the subtleties of the doctrine of contributory
negligence, questions of such extreme nicety are raised that a
third jury are required to give an opinion <i>upon the same state
of facts</i> upon which two juries have already decided in favour
of the plaintiff and her children.</p>
<p>Such is the power placed by our complicated, bewildering, and
inartistic mode of procedure, in the hands of a rich Company.</p>
<p>No one can call in question the wisdom or the learning of the
House of Lords: it is above criticism, and beyond censure; but
the <!-- page viii--><a name="pageviii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. viii</span>House of Lords itself works upon
the basis of our system of Procedure, and as that is neither
beyond criticism nor censure, I unhesitatingly ask, <i>Can Old
Fogeyism and Pettifoggism further go</i>?</p>
<p style="text-align: right">RICHARD HARRIS.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>October</i>, 1883.</p>
<h2><!-- page ix--><a name="pageix"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
ix</span>PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.</h2>
<p>When Old Fogeyism is being lowered to his last resting place,
Pettifoggism, being his chief mourner, will be so overwhelmed
with grief that he will tumble into the same grave.&nbsp; How
then to hasten the demise of this venerable Humbug is the
question.&nbsp; Some are for letting him die a natural death,
others for reducing him gradually by a system of slow starvation:
for myself, I confess, I am for knocking him on the head at
once.&nbsp; Until this event, so long wished for by all the
friends of Enlightenment and Progress, shall have happened, there
will be no possibility of a Reform which will lessen the needless
expense and shorten the unjustifiable delay which our present
system of legal procedure occasions; a system which gives to the
rich immeasurable <!-- page x--><a name="pagex"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. x</span>advantages over poor litigants; and
amounts in many cases not only to a perversion of justice but to
a denial of it altogether.</p>
<p>Old Fogeyism only tinkers at reform, and is so nervous and
incompetent that in attempting to mend one hole he almost
invariably makes two.&nbsp; The Public, doubtless, will, before
long, undertake the much needed reform and abolish some of the
unnecessary business of &ldquo;judges&rsquo; chambers,&rdquo;
where the ingenuity of the Pettifogging Pleader is so
marvellously displayed.&nbsp; How many righteous claims are
smothered in their infancy at this stage of their existence!</p>
<p>I have endeavoured to bring the evils of our system before the
Public in the story of Mr. Bumpkin.&nbsp; The solicitors, equally
with their clients, as a body, would welcome a change which would
enable actions to be carried to a legitimate conclusion instead
of being stifled by the &ldquo;Priggs&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Locusts&rdquo; who will crawl into an honorable
profession.&nbsp; It is impossible to keep them out, but it is
not impossible to prevent their using the profession to the
injury of their clients.&nbsp; All respectable solicitors would
<!-- page xi--><a name="pagexi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xi</span>be glad to see the powers of these unscrupulous
gentlemen curtailed.</p>
<p>The verses at the end of the story have been so often
favourably received at the Circuit Mess, that I thought an
amplified version of them in prose would not be unacceptable to
the general reader, and might ultimately awaken in the public
mind a desire for the long-needed reform of our legal
procedure.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>July</i>, 1883.</p>
<h2><!-- page xiii--><a name="pagexiii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xiii</span>ADVERTISEMENT.</h2>
<p>On the 4th of December, 1882, Our Gracious Queen, on the
occasion of the opening of the Royal Courts of Justice,
said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I trust that the uniting together in one
place of the various branches of Judicature in this my Supreme
Court, will conduce to the <i>more efficient</i> and
<i>speedy</i> administration of justice to my
subjects.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On April 20th, 1883, in the House of Commons, Mr. H. H. Fowler
asked the Attorney-General whether he was aware of the large
number of causes waiting for trial in the Chancery Division of
the High Court, and in the Court of Appeal; and whether the
Government proposed to take any steps to remedy the delay and
increased cost occasioned to the suitors by the present
administration of the Judicature Acts.</p>
<p>The Attorney-General said the number of cases of all
descriptions then waiting for trial in the Chancery Division was
848, and in the Court of Appeal 270.&nbsp; The House would be
aware that a committee of Judges had been engaged for some time
in framing rules in the <!-- page xiv--><a
name="pagexiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xiv</span>hope of
getting rid of some of the delay that now existed in the hearing
of cases; and until those rules were prepared, which would be
shortly, the Government were not desirous of interfering with a
matter over which the Judges had jurisdiction.&nbsp; The
Government were now considering the introduction of a short
Judicature Act for the purpose of lessening the
delay.&mdash;<i>Morning Post</i>.</p>
<p>[No rules or short Judicature Act at present!] <a
name="citation0a"></a><a href="#footnote0a"
class="citation">[0a]</a></p>
<p>On the 13th April, 1883, Mr. Glasse, Q.C., thus referred to a
statement made by Mr. Justice Pearson of the Chancery Division:
&ldquo;The citizens of this great country, of which your Lordship
is one of the representatives, will look at the statement you
have made with respectful amazement.&rdquo;&nbsp; The statement
appears to <!-- page xv--><a name="pagexv"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xv</span>have been, that his Lordship had
intended to continue the business of the Court in exactly the
same way in which it had been conducted by Mr. Justice Fry; but
he had been informed that he would have to take the interlocutory
business of Mr. Justice Kay&rsquo;s Court whilst his Lordship
<i>was on Circuit</i>; and, as it was requisite that he should
take his own interlocutory business <i>before the causes set down
for hearing</i>, &ldquo;<span class="smcap">all the Causes in the
two Courts must go to the wall</span>&rdquo;!!!&nbsp; His
Lordship added, that it would be necessary for him to rise at 3
o&rsquo;clock every day (not at 3 o&rsquo;clock in the
<i>morning</i>, gentle reader), because he understood he should
have to conduct the business of Mr. Justice Kay&rsquo;s Chambers
as well as his own.&mdash;<i>Morning Post</i>.</p>
<p>On the 16th April, 1883, Mr. Justice Day, in charging the
Grand Jury at the Manchester Spring Assizes, expressed his
disagreement with the opinion of the other Judges in favour of
the Commission being so altered that the Judge would have to
&ldquo;<i>deliver all the prisoners detained in gaol</i>,&rdquo;
and regarded it as &ldquo;a waste of the Judge&rsquo;s time that
he should have to try a case in which a woman was indicted for
<i>stealing a shawl worth</i> 3<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>; or a
prisoner charged with stealing <i>two mutton pies</i> and <i>two
ounces of bacon</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Evening Standard</i>.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">The beauty of a farm yard on a Sabbath day,
and what a difference a single letter will sometimes make in the
legal signification of a sentence.</p>
<p>It was during the Long Vacation&mdash;that period which is
Paradise to the Rich and Purgatory to the Poor Lawyer&mdash;to
say nothing of the client, who simply exists as a necessary evil
in the economy of our enlightened system of Legal Procedure: it
was during this delightful or dismal period that I returned one
day to my old Farm-house in Devonshire, from a long and
interesting ramble.&nbsp; My excellent thirst and appetite having
been temperately appeased, I seated myself cosily by the huge
chimney, where the log was always burning; and, having lighted my
pipe, surrendered my whole being to the luxurious enjoyment of so
charming a situation.&nbsp; I had scarcely finished smoking, when
I fell into a sound and delicious sleep.&nbsp; And behold! I
dreamed a dream; and methought:</p>
<p>It was a beautiful Sabbath morning, in the early part of May,
18--, when two men might have been seen leaning over a
pigstye.&nbsp; The pigstye was situated in a <!-- page 2--><a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>farm-yard in
the lovely village of Yokelton, in the county of Somerset.&nbsp;
Both men had evidently passed what is called the &ldquo;prime of
life,&rdquo; as was manifest from their white hair, wrinkled
brows, and stooping shoulders.&nbsp; It was obvious that they
were contemplating some object with great interest and thoughtful
attention.</p>
<p>And I perceived that in quiet and respectful conversation with
them was a fine, well-formed, well-educated sow of the Chichester
breed.&nbsp; It was plain from the number of her rings that she
was a sow of great distinction, and, indeed, as I afterwards
learned, was the most famous for miles around: her progeny (all
of whom I suppose were honourables) were esteemed and sought by
squire and farmer.&nbsp; How that sow was bred up to become so
polite a creature, was a mystery to all; because there were
gentlemen&rsquo;s homesteads all around, where no such
thoroughbred could be found.&nbsp; But I suppose it&rsquo;s the
same with pigs as it is with men: a well-bred gentleman may work
in the fields for his living, and a cad may occupy the
manor-house or the nobleman&rsquo;s hall.</p>
<p>The Chichester sow looked up with an air of easy nonchalance
into the faces of the two men who smoked their short pipes, and
uttered ever and anon some short ejaculation, such as,
&ldquo;Hem!&rdquo; &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; &ldquo;Zounds!&rdquo; and so
forth, while the sow exhibited a familiarity with her superiors
only to be acquired by mixing in the best society.&nbsp; There
was a respectful deference which, while it betrayed no sign of
servility, was in pleasing contrast with the boisterous and
somewhat unbecoming levity of the other inhabitants of the
stye.&nbsp; These people were the last progeny of this
illustrious Chichester, and numbered <!-- page 3--><a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>in all
eleven&mdash;seven sons and four daughters&mdash;honourables
all.&nbsp; It was impossible not to admire the high spirit of
this well-descended family.&nbsp; That they had as yet received
no education was due to the fact that their existence dated only
from the 21st of January last.&nbsp; Hence their somewhat erratic
conduct, such as jumping, running, diving into the straw, boring
their heads into one another&rsquo;s sides, and other
unceremonious proceedings in the presence of the two gentlemen
whom it is necessary now more particularly to describe.</p>
<p>Mr. Thomas Bumpkin, the elder of the two, was a man of about
seventy summers, as tall and stalwart a specimen of Anglo-Saxon
peasantry as you could wish to behold.&nbsp; And while I use the
word &ldquo;peasantry&rdquo; let it be clearly understood that I
do so in no sense as expressing Mr. Bumpkin&rsquo;s present
condition.&nbsp; He had risen from the English peasantry, and was
what is usually termed a &ldquo;self-made man.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
was born in a little hut consisting of &ldquo;wattle and
dab,&rdquo; and as soon as he could make himself heard was sent
into the fields to &ldquo;mind the birds.&rdquo;&nbsp; Early in
the November mornings, immediately after the winter sowings, he
would be seen with his little bag of brown bread round his neck,
trudging along with a merry whistle, as happy as if he had been
going home to a bright fire and a plentiful breakfast of ham,
eggs, and coffee.&nbsp; By degrees he had raised himself to the
position of ploughman, and never ploughman drove a straighter or
leveller furrow.&nbsp; He had won prizes at the annual ploughing
and harrowing matches: and upon the strength of ten and sixpence
a week had married Nancy Tugby, to whom he had been engaged off
and on for eleven years.&nbsp; Nancy was a frugal housewife, and
worked hard, morning, noon and night.&nbsp; She was quite a
treasure <!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>to Bumpkin; and, what with taking in a
little washing, and what with going out to do a little charing,
and what with Tom&rsquo;s skill in mending cart-harness (nearly
all the cart-harness in the neighbourhood was in a perpetual
state of &ldquo;mendin&rsquo;&rdquo;), they had managed to put
together in a year or two enough money to buy a sow.&nbsp; This,
Tom always said, was &ldquo;his first start.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
mighty proud they both were as they stood together of a Sunday
morning looking at this wonderful treasure.&nbsp; The sow soon
had pigs, and the pigs got on and were sold, and then the money
was expended in other things, which in their turn proved equally
remunerative.&nbsp; Then Tom got a piece of land, and next a pet
ewe-lamb, and so on, until little by little wealth accumulated,
and he rented at last, after a long course of laborious years,
from the Squire, a small homestead called &ldquo;Southwood
Farm,&rdquo; consisting of some fifty acres.&nbsp; Let it not be
supposed that the accession of an extra head of live stock was a
small matter.&nbsp; Everything is great or little by
relation.&nbsp; I believe the statesman himself knows no greater
pleasure when he first obtains admission to the Cabinet, than Tom
did when he took possession of his little farm.&nbsp; And he
certainly experienced as great a joy when he got a fresh pig as
any young barrister does when he secures a new client.</p>
<p>Southwood Farm was a lovely homestead, situated near a very
pretty river, and in the midst of the most picturesque
scenery.&nbsp; The little rivulet (for it was scarcely more)
twisted about in the quaintest conceivable manner, almost
encircling the cosy farm; while on the further side rose abruptly
from the water&rsquo;s edge high embankments studded thickly with
oak, ash, and an undergrowth of saplings of almost every
variety.&nbsp; The old house was spacious for <!-- page 5--><a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>the size of the
farm, and consisted of a large living-room, ceiled with massive
oak beams and oak boards, which were duly whitewashed, and looked
as white as the sugar on a wedding cake.&nbsp; The fireplace was
a huge space with seats on either side cut in the wall; while
from one corner rose a rude ladder leading to a bacon loft.&nbsp;
Dog-irons of at least a century old graced the brick hearth,
while the chimney-back was adorned with a huge slab of iron
wrought with divers quaint designs, and supposed to have been in
some way or other connected with the Roman invasion, as it had
been dug up somewhere in the neighbourhood, by whom or when no
one ever knew.&nbsp; There was an inner chamber besides the one
we are now in, which was used as a kitchen; while on the opposite
side was a little parlour with red-tiled floor and a
comparatively modern grate.&nbsp; This was the reception room,
used chiefly when any of the ladies from
&ldquo;t&rsquo;Squoire&rsquo;s&rdquo; did Mrs. Bumpkin the honour
to call and taste her tea-cakes or her gooseberry wine.&nbsp; The
thatched roof was gabled, and the four low-ceiled bedrooms had
each of them a window in a gable.&nbsp; The house stood in a
well-stocked garden, beyond which was a lovely green meadow
sloping to the river side.&nbsp; In front was the little
farm-yard, with its double-bayed barn, its lean-to cow-houses,
its stables for five horses, and its cosy loft.&nbsp; Then there
were the pigstyes and the henhouses: all forming together a very
convenient and compact homestead.&nbsp; Adjoining the home meadow
was a pretty orchard, full of apple, pear, cherry and plum trees;
and if any one could imagine that Mr. and Mrs. Bumpkin had no eye
or taste for the beautiful, I would have advised that
ill-conditioned person to visit those good people of a Sunday
morning after &ldquo;brakfast&rdquo; when <!-- page 6--><a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>the orchard was
in full blossom.&nbsp; This beautiful picture it was not only Mr.
and Mrs. Bumpkin&rsquo;s special joy to behold, but their great
and proud delight to show; and if they had painted the blossoms
themselves they could not have felt more intense enjoyment and
satisfaction.</p>
<p>There was one other feature about the little farm which I must
mention, because it is one of the grandest and most beautiful
things in nature, and that is the magnificent &ldquo;Old
Oak&rdquo; that stood in the corner of one of the home fields,
and marked the boundary of the farm in that direction.&nbsp; If
the measure of its girth would be interesting to the reader to
know, it was just twenty-seven feet: not the largest in England
certainly, notwithstanding which the tree was one of the grandest
and most beautiful.&nbsp; It towered high into the air and spread
its stalwart branches like giant trees in all directions.&nbsp;
It was said to be a thousand years old, and to be inhabited by
owls and ghosts.&nbsp; Whether the ghosts lived there or not I am
unable to say, but from generation to generation the tradition
was handed down and believed to be true.&nbsp; Such was Mr.
Bumpkin&rsquo;s home, in my dream: the home of Peace and Plenty,
Happiness and Love.</p>
<p>The man who was contemplating Mr. Bumpkin&rsquo;s pigs on this
same Sunday morning was also a &ldquo;self-made man,&rdquo; whose
name was Josiah <span class="smcap">Snooks</span>.&nbsp; He was
not made so well as Bumpkin, I should say, by a great deal, but
nevertheless was a man who, as things go, was tolerably well put
together.&nbsp; He was the village coal-merchant, not a Cockerell
by any means, but a merchant who would have a couple of trucks of
&ldquo;Derby Brights&rdquo; down at a time, and sell them round
the village by the hundredweight.&nbsp; No doubt he was a very
thrifty man, and to the extent, so some people said, of nipping
the poor <!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>in their weight.&nbsp; And once he
nearly lost the contract for supplying the coal-gifts at
Christmas on that account.&nbsp; But he made it a rule to attend
church very regularly as the season came round, and so did Mrs.
Josiah Snooks; and it will require a great deal of
&ldquo;nipping&rdquo; to get over that in a country village, I
promise you.&nbsp; I did not think Snooks a nice looking man, by
any means; for he had a low forehead, a scowling brow, a nobbly
fat nose, small eyes, one of which had a cast, a large mouth
always awry and distorted with a sneer, straight hair that hung
over his forehead, and a large scar on his right cheek.&nbsp; His
teeth were large and yellow, and the top ones protruded more, I
thought, than was at all necessary.&nbsp; Nor was he generally
beliked.&nbsp; In fact, so unpopular was this man with the poor,
that it was a common thing for mothers to say to their children
when they could not get them in of a summer&rsquo;s evening,
&ldquo;You, Betsy,&rdquo; or &ldquo;You, Jane, come in directly,
or old Snooks will have you!&rdquo;&nbsp; A warning which always
produced the desired effect.</p>
<p>No one could actually tell whether Snooks had made money or
merely pretended to possess it.&nbsp; Some said they knew he had,
for he lived so niggardly; others said the coal trade was not
what it was; and there were not wanting people who hinted that
old Betty Bodger&rsquo;s house and garden&mdash;which had been
given to her years ago by the old squire, what for, nobody
knew&mdash;had been first mortgaged to Josiah and then sold to
him and &ldquo;taken out in coals.&rdquo;&nbsp; A very cunning
man was Snooks; kept his own counsel&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mean a
barrister in wig and gown on his premises&mdash;but in the sense
of never divulging what was in his sagacious mind.&nbsp; He was
known as a universal buyer of everything that he could turn a
penny out of; and he sold everybody whenever <!-- page 8--><a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>he got the
chance.&nbsp; Such was the character of old Snooks.</p>
<p>How then came our good guileless friend Bumpkin to be
associated with such a man on this beautiful Sunday
morning?&nbsp; I can only answer: there are things in this world
which admit of no explanation.&nbsp; This, so far as I am
concerned, was one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They be pooty pork,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Middlin&rsquo;,&rdquo; rejoined the artful Snooks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They be a mighty dale more an middlin&rsquo;, if you
come to thic,&rdquo; said the farmer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen a good deal better,&rdquo; remarked
Snooks.&nbsp; This was always his line of bargaining.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I aint,&rdquo; returned Bumpkin,
emphatically.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look at that un&mdash;why, he be fit
for anything&mdash;a regler pictur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he worth?&rdquo; said Snooks.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Three arf crowns?&rdquo;&nbsp; That was Snooks&rsquo; way
of dealing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whisht!&rdquo; exclaimed Bumpkin; &ldquo;and four
arf-crowns wouldn&rsquo;t buy un.&rdquo;&nbsp; That was
Bumpkin&rsquo;s way.</p>
<p>Snooks expectorated and gave a roar, which he intended for a
laugh, but which made every pig jump off its feet and dive into
the straw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell &rsquo;ee what, maister Bumpkin, I doant want
un&rdquo;&mdash;that was his way again; &ldquo;but I doant mind
giving o&rsquo; thee nine shillings for that un.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thee wunt &rsquo;ave un&mdash;not a farden less nor ten
if I knows it; ye doant &rsquo;ave we loike that, nuther&mdash;ye
beant sellin&rsquo; coals, maister Snooks&mdash;no, nor
buyin&rsquo; pigs if I knows un.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How far this conversation would have proceeded, and whether
any serious altercation would have arisen, I know not; but at
this moment a combination of <!-- page 9--><a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>circumstances
occurred to interrupt the would-be contracting parties.&nbsp;
First, Mrs. Bumpkin, who had been preparing the Sunday dinner,
came across the yard with her apron full of cabbage-leaves and
potato-peelings, followed by an immense number of chickens, while
the ducks in the pond clapped their wings, and flew and ran with
as much eagerness as though they were so many lawyers seeking
some judicial appointment, and Mrs. Bumpkin were Lord High
Chancellor of Great Britain; and they made as much row as a flock
of Chancery Barristers arguing about costs.&nbsp; Then came
along, with many a grunt and squeak, a pig or two, who seemed to
be enjoying a Sunday holiday in their best clothes, for they had
just come out of a puddle of mud; then came slouching along, a
young man whose name was Joe (or, more correctly speaking, Joseph
Wurzel), a young man of about seventeen, well built, tall and
straight, with a pleasant country farm-house face, a roguish
black eye, even teeth, and a head of brown straight hair, that
looked as if the only attention it ever received was an
occasional trimming with a reap-hook, and a brush with a
bush-harrow.</p>
<p>It was just feeding time; that was why Joe came up at this
moment; and in addition to all these circumstances, there came
faintly booming through the trees the ding of the old church
bell, reminding Mr. Bumpkin that he must &ldquo;goo and smarten
oop a bit&rdquo; for church.&nbsp; He already had on his purple
cord trousers, and, as Joe termed it, his hell-fire waistcoat
with the flames coming out of it in all directions; but he had to
put on his drab &ldquo;cooat&rdquo; and white smock-frock, and
then walk half a mile before service commenced.&nbsp; He always
liked to be there before the Squire, and see him and his
daughters, Miss Judith and Miss Mary, come in.</p>
<p><!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>So he had to leave the question of the
&ldquo;walley&rdquo; of the pig and attend to the more important
interests of his immortal soul.&nbsp; But now as he was going
comes the point to which the reader&rsquo;s special attention is
directed.&nbsp; He had got about six yards from the stye, or it
may have been a little more, when Snooks cried out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve bought un for nine and six.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To which Mr. Bumpkin replied, without so much as turning his
head&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ave ur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now this expression, according to Chitty on Contracts, would
mean, &ldquo;Have you, indeed? Mr. Snooks.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the
extreme cunning of Josiah converted it into &ldquo;&rsquo;Ave
un,&rdquo; which, by the same learned authority would signify,
&ldquo;Very well, Mr. Snooks, you can have him.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">The simplicity and enjoyments of a country
life depicted.</p>
<p>A quiet day was Sunday on Southwood Farm.&nbsp; Joe used to
slumber in the meadows among the buttercups, or in the loft, or
near the kitchen-fire, as the season and weather invited.&nbsp;
That is to say, until such time as, coming out of Sunday School
(for to Sunday School he sometimes went) he saw one of the
fairest creatures he had ever read about either in the Bible or
elsewhere!&nbsp; It was a very strange thing she should be so
different from everybody else: not even the clergyman&rsquo;s
daughters&mdash;no, nor the Squire&rsquo;s daughters, for the
matter of that&mdash;looked half so nice as pretty Polly
Sweetlove, the housemaid at the Vicar&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now look at that,&rdquo; said Joe, as he went along the
lane on that Sunday when he first beheld this divine
creature.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m danged if she beant about the
smartest lookin o&rsquo; any on &rsquo;em.&nbsp; Miss Mary beant
nothing to her: it&rsquo;s a dandelion to a toolup.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So ever since that time Joe had slept less frequently in the
hay-loft on a Sunday afternoon; and, be it said to his credit,
had attended his church with greater punctuality.&nbsp; The vicar
took great notice of the lad&rsquo;s religious tendencies, and
had him to his night-school at the vicarage, in consequence; and
certainly no vicar ever <!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>knew a boy more regular in his
attendance.&nbsp; He was there waiting to go in ever so long
before the school began, and was always the very last to leave
the premises.</p>
<p>Often he would peep over the quick-set hedge into the
kitchen-window, just to catch a glance of this lovely
angel.&nbsp; And yet, so far as he could tell, she had never
looked at him.&nbsp; When she opened the door, Joe always felt a
thrill run through him as if some extraordinary thing had
happened.&nbsp; It was a kind of jump; and yet he had jumped many
times before that: &ldquo;it wasn&rsquo;t the sort of
jump,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as a chap gits either from
bein&rsquo; frit or bein&rsquo; pleased.&rdquo;&nbsp; And what to
make of it he didn&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; Then Polly&rsquo;s cap was
about the loveliest thing, next to Polly herself, he had ever
seen.&nbsp; It was more like a May blossom than anything else, or
a beautiful butterfly on the top of a water-lily.&nbsp; In fact,
all the rural images of a rude but not inartistic mind came and
went as this country boy thought of his beautiful Polly.&nbsp; As
he ploughed the field, if he saw a May-blossom in the hedgerow,
it reminded him of Polly&rsquo;s cap; and even the little gentle
daisy was like Polly herself.&nbsp; Pretty Polly was
everywhere!</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Bumpkin, on a fine Sabbath afternoon, would take
their pastime in the open air.&nbsp; First Mr. Bumpkin would take
down his long churchwarden pipe from its rack on the ceiling,
where it lay in close companionship with an ancient flint-gun;
then he would fill it tightly, so as to make it last the longer,
with tobacco from his leaden jar; and then, having lighted it, he
and his wife would go out of the back door, through the garden
and the orchard, and along by the side of the quiet river.&nbsp;
By their side, as a matter of course, came <!-- page 13--><a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>Tim the
Collie (named after Mrs. Bumpkin&rsquo;s grandfather Timothy),
who knew as well as possible every word that was being
said.&nbsp; If Mrs. Bumpkin only asked, &ldquo;Where is
Betsy?&rdquo; (that was the head Alderney cow) Tim would bark and
fly across to the meadow where she was; and then, having said to
her and to the five other Alderney cows and four heifers,
&ldquo;Why, here&rsquo;s master and missus coming round to look
at you, why on earth don&rsquo;t you come and see them?&rdquo; up
the whole herd would come, straggling one after the other, to the
meadow where Mr. and Mrs. Bumpkin were waiting for them; and all
would look over the hedge, as much as to say, &ldquo;How
d&rsquo;ye do, master, and how d&rsquo;ye do, missus; what a nice
day, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; exactly in the same manner as men and
women greet one another as often as they meet.&nbsp; And then
there was the old donkey, Jack, whom Tim would chaff no matter
when or where he saw him.&nbsp; I believe if Tim had got him in
church, he would have chaffed him.&nbsp; It was very amusing to
see Jack duck his head and describe a circle as Tim swept round
him, barking with all his might, and yet only laughing all the
while.&nbsp; Sometimes Jack, miscalculating distances&mdash;he
wasn&rsquo;t very great at mathematics&mdash;and having no eye
for situations, would kick out vigorously with his hind legs,
thinking Tim was in close proximity to his heels; whereas the
sagacious and jocular Tim was leaning on his outstretched
fore-feet immediately in front of Jack&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>Then there was another sight, not the least interesting on
these afternoon rambles: in the far meadow, right under
&ldquo;the lids,&rdquo; as they were called, lived the famous
Bull of Southwood Farm.&nbsp; He was Mrs. Bumpkin&rsquo;s
pet.&nbsp; She had had him from a baby, and used to feed him in
<!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>his infant days from a bottle by the kitchen fire.&nbsp;
And so docile was he that, although few strangers would be safe
in intruding into his presence, he would follow Mrs. Bumpkin
about, as she said, &ldquo;just like a Christian.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The merits of this bull were the theme, on all appropriate
occasions, of Mrs. Bumpkin&rsquo;s unqualified praise.&nbsp; If
the Vicar&rsquo;s wife called, as she sometimes did, to see how
Mrs. Bumpkin was getting on, Mrs. Bumpkin&rsquo;s
&ldquo;baby&rdquo; (that is the bull) was sure to be brought
up&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mean by the nurse, but in
conversation.&nbsp; No matter how long she waited her
opportunity, Mrs. Goodheart never left without hearing something
of the exploits of this remarkable bull.&nbsp; In truth, he was a
handsome, well-bred fellow.&nbsp; He had come from the
Squire&rsquo;s&mdash;so you may be sure his breed was gentlemanly
in the extreme; and his grandmother, on the maternal side, had
belonged to the Bishop of Winchester; so you have a sufficient
guarantee, I hope, for his moral character and orthodox
principles.&nbsp; Indeed, it had been said that no dissenter
dared pass through the meadow where he was, in consequence of his
connection with the Establishment.&nbsp; Now, on the occasions
when Mr. and Mrs. Bumpkin took their walks abroad through the
meadows to see their lambkins and their bull skip, this is what
would invariably happen.&nbsp; First, Mrs. Bumpkin would go
through the little cosy-looking gate in the corner of the meadow,
right down by the side of the old boat-house; then Mr. Bumpkin
would follow, holding his long pipe in one hand and his ash-stick
in the other.&nbsp; Then, away in the long distance, at the far
end of the meadow (he was always up there on these occasions),
stood &ldquo;Sampson&rdquo; (that was the bull), with his head
turned right round towards his master and mistress, as <!-- page
15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>if he
were having his photograph taken.&nbsp; Thus he stood for a
moment; then down went his huge forehead to the ground; up went
his tail to the sky; then he sent a bellow along the earth which
would have frightened anybody but his &ldquo;mother,&rdquo; and
started off towards his master and mistress like a ship in a
heavy sea; sometimes with his keel up in the air, and sometimes
with his prow under water: it not only was playful, it was
magnificent, and anybody unaccustomed to oxen might have been a
little terrified by the furious glare of his eyes and the
terrible snort of his nostrils as he approached.</p>
<p>Not so Mrs. Bumpkin, who held out her hand, and
ejaculated,</p>
<p>&ldquo;My pretty baby; my sweet pet; good Sampson!&rdquo; and
many other expressions of an endearing character.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Sampson&rdquo; looked, snorted, danced, plunged
and careered; and then came up and let Mrs. Bumpkin stroke and
pat him; while Bumpkin looked on, smoking his pipe peacefully,
and thinking what a fine fellow he, the bull, was, and what a
great man he, Bumpkin, must be to be the possessor of
&ldquo;sich!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus the peaceful afternoon would glide quietly and sweetly
away, and so would the bull, after the interesting interview was
over.</p>
<p>They always returned in time for tea, and then Mrs. Bumpkin
would go to evening service, while Mr. Bumpkin would wait for her
on the little piece of green near the church, where neighbours
used to meet and chat of a Sunday evening; such as old Mr.
Gosling, the market gardener, and old Master Mott, the head
gardener to the Squire, and Master Cole, the farmer, and various
others, the original inhabitants of Yokelton; discussing <!--
page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>the weather and the crops, the probability of Mr. Tomson
getting in again at the vestry as waywarden; what kind of a
highway rate there would be for the coming year; how that horse
got on that Mr. Sooby bought at the fair; and various other
matters of importance to a village community.&nbsp; They would
also pass remarks upon any striking personage who passed them on
his way to church.&nbsp; Mr. Prigg, for instance, the village
lawyer, who, they said, was a remarkably upright and
down-straight sort of man; although his wife, they thought, was
&ldquo;a little bit stuck up like&rdquo; and gave herself airs a
little different from Mrs. Goodheart, who would &ldquo;always
talk to &rsquo;em jist the same as if she was one o&rsquo;
th&rsquo; people.&rdquo;&nbsp; So that, on the whole, they
entertained themselves very amicably until such time as the
&ldquo;organ played the people out of church.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then
every one looked for his wife or daughter, as the case might be,
and wished one another good night: most of them having been to
church in the morning, they did not think it necessary to repeat
the performance in the evening.</p>

17</span>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Showing how true it is that it takes at least
two to make a bargain or a quarrel.</p>
<p>The day after the events which I have recorded, while the good
farmer and his wife were at breakfast, which was about seven
o&rsquo;clock, Joe presented himself in the sitting-room, and
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plase, maister, here be t&rsquo; money for t&rsquo;
pig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Money for t&rsquo; pig,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Bumpkin;
&ldquo;what&rsquo;s thee mean, lad? what pig?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maister Snooks!&rdquo; said Joe, &ldquo;there ur be,
gwine wi&rsquo; t&rsquo; pig in t&rsquo; barrer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing shall induce me to repeat the language of Mr. Bumpkin,
as he jumped up from the table, and without hat or cap rushed out
of the room, followed by Joe, and watched by Mrs. Bumpkin from
the door.&nbsp; Just as he got to the farmyard by one gate, there
was Snooks leaving it by another with Mr. Bumpkin&rsquo;s pig in
a sack in the box barrow which he was wheeling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hulloa!&rdquo; shouted the farmer; &ldquo;hulloa
here!&nbsp; Thee put un down&mdash;dang thee, what be this?&nbsp;
I said thee shouldn&rsquo;t ave un, no more thee
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I beant gwine to breed Chichster pigs
for such as thee at thy own price, nuther.&rdquo;&nbsp; Snooks
grinned and went on his way, saying;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bought un and I&rsquo;ll &rsquo;ave un.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An I&rsquo;ll &rsquo;ave thee, dang&rsquo;d if I doant,
afore jussices; t&rsquo; Squoire&rsquo;ll tell thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>&ldquo;I doant keer for t&rsquo; Squire no more nor I do
for thee, old Bumpkin; thee be a cunnin&rsquo; man, but thee sold
I t&rsquo; pig and I&rsquo;ll &rsquo;ave un, and I got un too:
haw! haw! haw! an thee got t&rsquo;
money&mdash;nine-and-six&mdash;haw! haw! haw!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bumpkin by this time came up to him, but was so much out
of breath, or &ldquo;winded,&rdquo; that he was unable to carry
on the conversation, so he just tapped the bag with his stick as
if to be certain the pig was there, and sure enough it was, if
you might judge by the extraordinary wriggling that went on
inside the bag.</p>
<p>The indomitable Snooks, however, with the largest and most
hideous grin I ever saw, pushed on with his barrow, and Mr.
Bumpkin having now sufficiently recovered his breath, said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thee see ur tak un, didn&rsquo;t thee, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure did ur,&rdquo; answered the lad.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
seed un took un clane out o&rsquo; the stye, and put un in the
sack, and wheeled un away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! so ur did, Joe; stick to that, lad&mdash;stick to
un.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And thee seed I pay th&rsquo; money for un, Joe,
didn&rsquo;t thee?&rdquo; laughed Snooks.&nbsp; &ldquo;Seed I put
un on t&rsquo; poast, and thee took un oop&mdash;haw! haw!
haw!&nbsp; I got t&rsquo; pig and thee got t&rsquo;
money&mdash;haw! haw! haw!&nbsp; Thee thowt thee&rsquo;d done I,
and I done thee&mdash;haw! haw! haw!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And away went Snooks and away went pig; but Snooks&rsquo;
laugh remained, and every now and then Snooks turned his head and
showed his large yellow teeth and roared again.</p>
<p>The rage of Mr. Bumpkin knew no bounds.&nbsp; There are some
things in life which are utterly unendurable; and one is the
having your pig taken from you against your will and without your
consent&mdash;an act which would be described legally as <i>the
rape of the pig</i>.&nbsp; This offence, <!-- page 19--><a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>in Mr.
Bumpkin&rsquo;s judgment, Snooks was guilty of; and therefore he
resolved to do that which is considered usually a wise thing,
namely, to consult a solicitor.</p>
<p>Now, if I were giving advice&mdash;which I do not presume to
do&mdash;I should say that in all matters of difficulty a man
should consult his wife, his priest, or his solicitor, and in the
order in which I have named them.&nbsp; In the event of
consulting a solicitor the next important question arises,
&ldquo;What solicitor?&rdquo;&nbsp; I could write a book on this
subject.&nbsp; There are numerous solicitors, within my
acquaintance, to whom I would entrust my life and my character;
there are some, not of my acquaintance, but of my knowledge, into
whose hands, if I had one spark of Christian feeling left, I
would not see my enemy delivered.&nbsp; There is little
difference between one class of men and another as to natural
disposition; and whether you take one or another, you must find
the shady character.&nbsp; But where the opportunities for
mischief are so great as they are in the practice of the Law, it
is necessary that the utmost care should be exercised in
committing one&rsquo;s interests to the keeping of another.&nbsp;
Had Mr. Bumpkin been a man of the world he would have suspected
that under the most ostentatious piety very often lurked the most
subtle fraud.&nbsp; Good easy man, had he been going to buy a
hay-stack, he would not have judged by the outside but have put
his &ldquo;iron&rdquo; into it; he could not put his iron into
Mr. Prigg, I know, but he need not have taken him by his
appearance alone.&nbsp; I may observe that if Mr. Bumpkin had
consulted his sensible and affectionate spouse, or a really
respectable solicitor, this book would not have been
written.&nbsp; If he had consulted the Vicar, possibly another
book might have been written; but, as it was, he resolved to
consult <!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>Mr. Prigg in the first
instance.&nbsp; Now Mrs. Bumpkin, except as the mother of the
illustrious Bull, has very little to do with this story.&nbsp;
Mr. Prigg is one of its leading characters; but in my description
of that gentleman I am obliged to be concise: I must minimize
Prigg, great as he is, and I trust that in doing so I shall
prospectively minimize all future Priggs that may ever appear on
the world&rsquo;s stage.&nbsp; I do not attempt to pulverize him,
that would require the crushing pestle of the legislature; but
merely to make him as little as I can, with due consideration for
the requirements of my story.</p>
<p>I should be thought premature in mentioning Prigg, but that he
was a gentleman of great pretensions in the little village of
Yokelton.&nbsp; Gentleman by Act of Parliament, and in his own
estimation, you may be sure he was respected by all around
him.&nbsp; That was not many, it is true, for his house was the
last of the straggling village.&nbsp; He was a man of great piety
and an extremely white neck-cloth; attended the parish church
regularly, and kept his white hair well brushed upwards&mdash;as
though, like the church steeple, it was to point the way at all
times.&nbsp; He was the most amiable of persons in regard to the
distribution of the parish gifts; and, being a lawyer it was not
considered by the churchwardens, a blacksmith and a builder, safe
to refuse his kind and generous assistance.&nbsp; He involved the
parish in a law-suit once, in a question relating to the duty to
repair the parish pump; and since that time everyone knew better
than to ignore Mr. Prigg.&nbsp; I have heard that the money spent
in that action would have repaired all the parish pumps in
England for a century, but have no means of ascertaining the
truth of this statement.</p>
<p>Mr. Prigg was a man whose merits were not appreciated <!--
page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>by the local gentry, who never asked him to
dinner.&nbsp; Virtue is thus sometimes ill-rewarded in this
world.&nbsp; And Mrs. Prigg&rsquo;s virtue had also been equally
ignored when she had sought, almost with tears, to obtain tickets
for the County Ball.</p>
<p>Mr. Prigg was about sixty years old, methodical in his habits,
punctilious in his dress, polite in his demeanour, and precise in
his language.&nbsp; He wore a high collar of such remarkable
stiffness that his shoulders had to turn with his head whenever
it was necessary to alter his position.&nbsp; This gave an
appearance of respectability to the head, not to be acquired by
any other means.&nbsp; It was, indeed, the most respectable head
I ever saw either in the flesh or in marble.</p>
<p>Mr. Prigg had descended from the well-known family of Prigg,
and he prided himself on the circumstance.&nbsp; How often was he
seen in the little churchyard of Yokelton of a Sunday morning,
both before and after service, pointing with family pride to the
tombstone of a relative which bore this beautiful and touching
inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p>High Birth, like Great Wealth, can afford to condescend!</p>
<p>Mrs. Prigg was worthy of her illustrious consort.&nbsp; She
was of the noble family of the Snobs, and in every way did honour
to her progenitors.&nbsp; As the reader is aware, there is what
is known as a &ldquo;cultivated voice,&rdquo; the result of
education&mdash;it is absolutely without affectation: there is
also the voice which, in imitation of the well-trained one, is
little more than a burlesque, and is <!-- page 23--><a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>affected in
the highest degree: this was the only fault in Mrs. Prigg&rsquo;s
voice.</p>
<p>Mr. Prigg&rsquo;s home was charmingly small, but had all the
pretensions of a stately country house&mdash;its conservatory,
its drawing-room, its study, and a dining-room which told you as
plainly as any dining-room could speak, &ldquo;I am related to
Donkey Hall, where the Squire lives: I belong to the same
aristocratic family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then there was the great heavy-headed clock in the
passage.&nbsp; He did not appear at all to know that he had come
down in the world through being sold by auction for two pounds
ten.&nbsp; He said with great plausibility, &ldquo;My worth is
not to be measured by the amount of money I can command; I am the
same personage as before.&rdquo;&nbsp; And I thought it a very
true observation, but the philosophy thereof was a little
discounted by his haughty demeanour, which had certainly gone up
as he himself had come down; and that is a reason why I
don&rsquo;t as a rule like people who have come down in the
world&mdash;they are sure to be so stuck up.&nbsp; But I do like
a person who has come down in the world and doesn&rsquo;t at all
mind it&mdash;much better than any man who has got up in the
world from the half-crown, and does mind it upon all
occasions.</p>
<p>Mrs. Prigg, apart from her high descent, was a very
aristocratic person: as the presence of the grand piano in the
drawing-room would testify.&nbsp; She could no more live without
a grand piano than ordinary people could exist without food: the
grand piano, albeit a very dilapidated one, was a necessity of
her well-descended condition.&nbsp; It was no matter that it
displaced more useful furniture; in that it only imitated a good
many other persons, and it told you whenever you entered the
room: &ldquo;You see <!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>me here in a comparatively small way,
but understand, I have been in far different circumstances: I
have been courted by the great, and listened to by the
aristocracy of England.&nbsp; I follow Mrs. Prigg wherever she
goes: she is a lady; her connections are high, and she never yet
associated with any but the best families.&nbsp; You could not
diminish from her very high breeding: put her in the workhouse,
and with me to accompany her, it would be transformed into a
palace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Prigg was by no means a rich man as the world counts
richness.&nbsp; No one ever heard of his having a
&ldquo;<i>practice</i>,&rdquo; although it was believed he did a
great deal in the way of &ldquo;lending his name&rdquo; <i>and
profession</i> to impecunious and uneducated men; who could turn
many a six-and-eightpence under its prestige.&nbsp; So great is
the moral &ldquo;power of attorney,&rdquo; as contradistinguished
from the legal &ldquo;power of attorney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Prigg, as I have hinted, was not only respectable, he was
<i>good</i>: he was more than that even, he was
<i>notoriously</i> good: so much so, that he was called, in
contradistinction to all other lawyers, &ldquo;<i>Honest Lawyer
Prigg</i>&rdquo;; and he had further acquired, almost as a
universal title, the sobriquet of &ldquo;Nice.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Everybody said, &ldquo;What a very nice man Mr. Prigg
is!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, in addition to all this, he was considered
<i>clever</i>&mdash;why, I do not know; but I have often observed
that men can obtain the reputation of being clever at very little
cost, and without the least foundation.&nbsp; The cheapest of all
ways is to abuse men who really are clever, and if your abuse be
pungently and not too coarsely worded, it will be accepted by the
ignorant as <i>criticism</i>.&nbsp; Nothing goes down with
shallow minds like criticism, and the severest criticism is
generally based on envy and jealousy.</p>
<p><!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>Mr. Prigg, then, was clever, respectable, good, and
nice, remarkably potent qualities for success in this world.</p>
<p>So I saw in my dream that Mr. Bumpkin, whose feelings were
duly aroused, turned his eye upon Honest Lawyer Prigg, and
resolved to consult him upon the grievous outrage to which he had
been subjected at the hands of the cunning Snooks: and without
more ado he resolved to call on that very worthy and extremely
nice gentleman.</p>
<h2><!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">On the extreme simplicity of going to law.</p>
<p>With his right leg resting on his left, with his two thumbs
nicely adjusted, and with the four points of his right fingers in
delicate contact with the fingers of his left hand, sat Honest
Lawyer Prigg, listening to the tale of unutterable woe, as
recounted by Farmer Bumpkin.</p>
<p>Sometimes the good man&rsquo;s eyes looked keenly at the
farmer, and sometimes they scanned vacantly the ceiling, where a
wandering fly seemed, like Mr. Bumpkin, in search of consolation
or redress.&nbsp; Sometimes Mr. Prigg nodded his respectable head
and shoulders in token of his comprehension of Mr.
Bumpkin&rsquo;s lucid statement: then he nodded two or three
times in succession, implying that the Court was with Mr.
Bumpkin, and occasionally he would utter with a soft soothing
voice,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he said &ldquo;quite so,&rdquo; he parted his fingers,
and reunited them with great precision; then he softly tapped
them together, closed his eyes, and seemed lost in profound
meditation.</p>
<p>Here Mr. Bumpkin paused and stared.&nbsp; Was Mr. Prigg
listening?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray proceed,&rdquo; said the lawyer, &ldquo;I quite
follow you;&mdash;never mind about what anybody else had offered
you for the pig&mdash;the question really is whether you actually
sold this pig to Snooks or not&mdash;whether the bargain was
complete or inchoate.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>Mr. Bumpkin stared again.&nbsp; &ldquo;I beant much of a
scollard, sir,&rdquo; he observed; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll take my
oath I never sold un t&rsquo;pig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the question,&rdquo; remarked the lawyer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You say you did not?&nbsp; Quite so; had this Joe of yours
any authority to receive money on your behalf?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Devil a bit,&rdquo; answered Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said Mr. Prigg, &ldquo;I have to put
these questions: it is necessary that I should understand where
we are: of course, if you did not sell the pig, he had no right
whatever to come and take it out of the sty&mdash;it was a
trespass?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I says,&rdquo; said Bumpkin; and down
went his fist on Mr. Prigg&rsquo;s table with such vehemence that
the solicitor started as though aroused by a shock of
dynamite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us be calm,&rdquo; said the lawyer, taking some
paper from his desk, and carefully examining the nib of a quill
pen, &ldquo;Let me see, I think you said your name was
Thomas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, sir; and so was my father&rsquo;s
afore me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thomas Bumpkin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beant ashamed on him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then Mr. Prigg wrote out a document and read it aloud; and
Mr. Bumpkin agreeing with it, scratched his name at the
bottom&mdash;very badly scratched it was, but well enough for Mr.
Prigg.&nbsp; This was simply to retain Mr. Prigg as his solicitor
in the cause of <i>Bumpkin</i> v. <i>Snooks</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so, quite so; now let me see; be calm, Mr.
Bumpkin, be calm; in all these matters we must never lose our
self-possession.&nbsp; You see, I am not excited.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>&ldquo;Noa,&rdquo; said Bumpkin; &ldquo;but then ur dint
tak thy pig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite true, I can appreciate the position, it was no
doubt a gross outrage.&nbsp; Now tell me&mdash;this Snooks, as I
understand, is the coal-merchant down the village?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s ur,&rdquo; said Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose he&rsquo;s a man of some property,
eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bumpkin looked for a few moments without speaking, and
then said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wur allays a close-fisted un, and I should reckon
have a goodish bit o&rsquo; property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you know,&rdquo; remarked the solicitor,
&ldquo;it is highly important, when one wins a case and obtains
damages, that the defendant should be in a position to pay
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the first time that ever the flavour of damages had
got into Bumpkin&rsquo;s mouth; and a very nice flavour it
was.&nbsp; To beat Snooks was one thing, a satisfaction; to make
him pay was another, a luxury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; he repeated; &ldquo;I bleeve he ave, I
bleeve he ave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wull, fust and foremust, I knows he lent a party a
matter of a hundred pound, for I witnessed un.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he hasn&rsquo;t got that,&rdquo; said the
lawyer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes ur ave, sir, or how so be as good; for it wur a
morgage like, and since then he&rsquo;ve got the
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Prigg made a note, and asked where the house was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It be widder Jackson&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed; very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An then there be the bisness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said the lawyer, &ldquo;horses and
carts, weighing machines, and so on?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>&ldquo;And the house he live in,&rdquo; said Bumpkin,
&ldquo;I know as ow that longs to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well; I think that will be enough to start
with.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, Mr. Prigg knew pretty well the position
of the respective parties himself; so it was not so much for his
own information that he made these inquiries as to infuse into
Bumpkin&rsquo;s mind a notion of the importance of the case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said he, throwing down the pen, &ldquo;this
is a very serious matter, Mr. Bumpkin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a comfort, and Bumpkin looked agreeably surprised and
vastly important.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very serious case,&rdquo; and again the tips of the
fingers were brought in contact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I spoase we can&rsquo;t bring un afore jusseses,
sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see the criminal law is dangerous; you
can&rsquo;t get damages, and you may get an action for malicious
prosecution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we ought to mak un pay for &rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is precisely my own view, but I am totally at a
loss to understand the reason of such outrageous conduct on the
part of this Snooks.&nbsp; Now don&rsquo;t be offended, Mr.
Bumpkin, if I put a question to you.&nbsp; You know, we lawyers
like to search to the bottom of things.&nbsp; I can understand,
if you had owed him any money&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Owe un money!&rdquo; exclaimed Bumpkin contemptuously;
&ldquo;why I could buy un out and out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, quite so, quite so; so I should have supposed from
what I know of you, Mr. Bumpkin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lookee ere, sir,&rdquo; said the farmer; &ldquo;I bin a
ard workin man all my life, paid my way, twenty shillins in the
pound, and doant owe a penny as fur as I knows.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>&ldquo;And if you did, Mr. Bumpkin,&rdquo; said the
lawyer with a good-natured laugh, &ldquo;I dare say you could
pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wull, I bleeve there&rsquo;s no man can axe me for
nothing; and thank God, what I&rsquo;ve got&rsquo;s my own; and
there aint many as got pootier stock nor mine&mdash;all good bred
uns, Mr. Prigg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve often heard your cattle
praised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He be a blagard if ur says I owed un money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, dear, Mr. Bumpkin, pray don&rsquo;t misunderstand
me; he did not, that I am aware, allege that he took the pig
because you owed him money; and even if you did, he could not
legally have done so.&nbsp; Now this is not a mere matter of
debt; it&rsquo;s a very serious case of trespass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay; zo &rsquo;t be sir; that was my bleef, might jist
as wull a tooked baacon out o&rsquo; baacon loft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the same.&nbsp; Quite so&mdash;quite

<p>&ldquo;And I want thee, Mr. Prigg, to mak un pay
for&rsquo;t&mdash;mak un pay, sir; it beant so much th&rsquo;
pig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so: quite so: that were a very trifling affair,
and might be settled in the County Court; but, in fact,
it&rsquo;s not the pig at all, it&rsquo;s trespass, and you want
to make him answerable in damages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, sir; you&rsquo;ve got un.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose an apology and a return of the pig would not
be enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make un know he beant everybody,&rdquo; said
Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so; now what shall we lay the damages
at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wull, sir, as for that, I doant rightly know; if so be
he&rsquo;d pay down, that&rsquo;s one thing, but it&rsquo;s my
bleef as you might jist as wull try to dror blood out of a stoane
as git thic feller to do what&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>&ldquo;Shall we say a hundred pounds and
costs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Never did man look more astonished than Bumpkin.&nbsp; A
hundred pounds!&nbsp; What a capital thing going to law must
be!&nbsp; But, as the reader knows, he was a remarkably discreet
man, and never in the course of his dealing committed himself
till the final moment.&nbsp; Whenever anybody made him a
&ldquo;bid,&rdquo; he invariably met the offer with one form of
refusal.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nay, nay; it beant good enough: I bin
offered moore.&rdquo;&nbsp; And this had answered so well, that
it came natural to Bumpkin to refuse on all occasions the first
offer.&nbsp; It was not to be wondered at then that the question
should be regarded in the light of an offer from Snooks
himself.&nbsp; Now he could hardly say &ldquo;I bin <i>bid
moore</i> money,&rdquo; because the case wasn&rsquo;t in the
market; but he could and did say the next best thing to it,
namely:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wunt let un goo for that&mdash;&rsquo;t be wuth
moore!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; observed Prigg; &ldquo;so long as we
know: we can lay our damages at what we please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now there was great consolation in that.&nbsp; The plaintiff
paused and rubbed his chin.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do thee think,
sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think if he pays something handsome, and gives us an
apology, and pays the costs, I should advise you to take
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you please, sir; I leaves it to you; I beant a hard
man, I hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good; we will see what can be done.&nbsp; I shall
bring this action in the Chancery Division.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hem! I&rsquo;ve eerd tell, sir, that if ever a case
gets into that ere Coourt he niver comes out agin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, that&rsquo;s all nonsense; there used to be a good
deal of truth in that; but the procedure is now so altered <!--
page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>that you can do pretty much what you like: this is an
age of despatch; you bring your action, and your writ is almost
like a cheque payable on demand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wull, I beant no lawyer, never had nothing to do wi un
in my life; but I should like to axe, sir, why thee&rsquo;ll
bring this ere case in Chancery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good; well, come now, I like to be frank; we shall get
more costs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bumpkin again rubbed his chin.&nbsp; &ldquo;And do I get
em?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they go towards expenses; the other side always
pays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a stroke of reasoning not to be gainsaid.&nbsp; But
Mr. Prigg had a further observation to make on the subject, and
it was this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the case has gone on up to being ready for trial,
and the Judges find that it is a case more fitting to be tried in
the Common Law Courts, then an order is made transferring it,
that is, sending it out of Chancery to be tried by one of the
other Judges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t see un,&rdquo; said Bumpkin, &ldquo;I beant
much of a scollard, but I tak it thee knows best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Prigg smiled: a beneficent, sympathizing smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it looks a little
mysterious, but we lawyers understand it; so, if you don&rsquo;t
mind, I shall bring it in the Chancery Division in the first
instance; and nice and wild the other side will be.&nbsp; I fancy
I see the countenance of Snooks&rsquo; lawyer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a good argument, and perfectly satisfactory to the
unsophisticated mind of Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;will ur come on,
think&rsquo;ee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, in due time; everything is done very quickly
now&mdash;not like it used to be&mdash;you&rsquo;d be surprised,
we <!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>used to have to wait years&mdash;yes, years, sir, before
an action could be tried; and now, why bless my soul, you get
judgment before you know where you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How true this turned out to be may hereafter appear; but in a
dream you never anticipate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall write at once,&rdquo; said &ldquo;Honest
Prigg,&rdquo; &ldquo;for compensation and an apology; I think I
would have an apology.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make un pay&mdash;I doant so much keer for the
t&rsquo;other thing; that beant much quonsequence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so&mdash;quite so.&rdquo;&nbsp; And with this
observation Mr. Prigg escorted his client to the door.</p>
<h2><!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">In which it appears that the sting of slander
is not always in the head.</p>
<p>Mr. Prigg lost no time in addressing a letter to the
ill-advised Josiah Snooks with the familiar and affectionate
commencement of &ldquo;Dear Sir,&rsquo;&rdquo; asking for
compensation for the &ldquo;gross outrage&rdquo; he had committed
upon &ldquo;his client;&rdquo; and an apology to be printed in
such papers as he, the client, should select.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Dear Sir&rdquo; replied, not in writing, for he was
too artful for that, but by returning, as became his vulgar
nature, Mr. Prigg&rsquo;s letter in a very torn and disgusting
condition.</p>
<p>To a gentleman of cultivated mind and sensitive nature, this
was intolerable; and Mr. Prigg knew that even the golden bridge
of compromise was now destroyed.&nbsp; He no longer felt as a
mere lawyer, anxious in the interests of his client, which was a
sufficient number of horse-power for anything, but like an
outraged and insulted gentleman, which was more after the force
of hydraulic pressure than any calculable amount of
horse-power.&nbsp; It was clear to his upright and sensitive mind
that Snooks was a low creature.&nbsp; Consequently all
professional courtesies were at an end: the writ was issued and
duly served upon the uncompromising Snooks.&nbsp; Now a writ is
not a matter to grin at and to treat with <!-- page 36--><a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>contempt or
levity.&nbsp; Mr. Snooks could not return that document to Mr.
Prigg, so he had to consider.&nbsp; And first he consulted his
wife: this consultation led to a domestic brawl and then to his
kicking one of his horses in the stomach.&nbsp; Then he threw a
shovel at his dog, and next the thought occurred to him that he
had better go and see Mr. Locust.&nbsp; This gentleman was a
solicitor who practised at petty sessions.&nbsp; He did not
practise much, but that was, perhaps, his misfortune rather than
his fault.&nbsp; He was a small, fiery haired man, with a close
cut tuft of beard; small eyes, and a pimply nose, which showed an
ostentatious disdain for everything beneath it.</p>
<p>Mr. Locust was not at home, but would return about nine.&nbsp;
At nine, therefore, the impatient Snooks appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Locust, as he looked at the writ,
&ldquo;I see this writ is issued by Mr. Prigg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he not write to you before issuing it?&mdash;dear
me, this is very sharp practice&mdash;very sharp practice: the
sharpest thing I ever heard of in all my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wull, he did write, but I giv un as good as he
sent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Locust; &ldquo;I am
afraid you have committed yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No I beant, sir,&rdquo; said the cunning Snooks, with a
grin, &ldquo;no I beant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should never write without consulting a
solicitor&mdash;bear that in mind, Mr. Snooks; it will be an
invaluable lesson&mdash;hem!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never writ, sir&mdash;I ony sent un his letter
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Locust, &ldquo;come now, that is
better; but still you should have consulted me.&nbsp; I see this
claim is for three hundred and fifty pounds&mdash;it&rsquo;s for
trespass.&nbsp; Now sit down quietly and calmly, and tell me the
facts.&rdquo;&nbsp; <!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>And then he took pen and paper and
placed himself in position to take his retainer and
instructions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wull, sir, it is as this: a Sunday mornin&mdash;no, a
Sunday mornin week&mdash;I won&rsquo;t tell no lie if I knows
it&mdash;a Sunday mornin week&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sunday morning week,&rdquo; writes Locust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I buyd a pig off this ere man for nine and six: well,
o&rsquo; the Monday mornin I goes with my barrer and a sack and I
fetches the pig and gies the money to his man Joe Wurzel;
leastways I puts it on the poast and he takes it up.&nbsp; Then
out comes Bumpkin and swears I never bought un at all, gets in a
rage and hits the bag wi&rsquo; a stick&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now stop,&rdquo; said the Lawyer; &ldquo;are you quite
sure he did not strike <i>you</i>?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the
point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, he would a&rsquo; done if I adn&rsquo;t a
bobbed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good: that&rsquo;s an assault in law.&nbsp; You are
sure he would have struck you if you hadn&rsquo;t ducked or
bobbed your head?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In course it would, else why should I bob?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so&mdash;just so.&nbsp; Now then, we&rsquo;ve got
him there&mdash;we&rsquo;ve got him nicely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Snooks&rsquo; eyes gleamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next I want to know: I suppose you didn&rsquo;t owe him
anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, nor no other man,&rdquo; said Snooks, with an air
of triumph.&nbsp; &ldquo;I worked hard for what I got, and no man
can&rsquo;t ax me for a farden.&nbsp; I allays paid twenty
shillings in the pound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reader will observe how virtuous both parties were on this
point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So!&rdquo; said Locust.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now you
haven&rsquo;t told me all that took place.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>&ldquo;That be about all, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes; but I suppose there was something said
between you&mdash;did you have any words&mdash;was he
angry&mdash;did he call you any names or say anything in an angry
way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, not partickler&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not particular: I will judge of that.&nbsp; Just tell
me what was said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, begin on the Sunday morning.&nbsp; What was first
said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Snooks told the Solicitor all that took place, with
sundry additions which his imagination supplied when his memory
failed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I member the price wull, becos he said &lsquo;You
beant sellin coals, recollect, so you doant ave me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho! ho!&rdquo; exclaimed Locust rubbing his hands,
&ldquo;You are sure he said that?&rdquo; writing down the words
carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will do, we&rsquo;ve got him: we&rsquo;ve got him
nicely.&nbsp; Was anybody present when he said this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&nbsp; Joe were there, and t&rsquo; best
o&rsquo; my belief, Mrs. Bumpkin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind Mrs. Bumpkin.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t suppose
she was there, if you come to recollect; it&rsquo;s quite enough
if Joe was present and could hear what was said.&nbsp; I suppose
he could hear it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stood cloase by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well&mdash;that is slander&mdash;and slander of a
very gross kind.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve got him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be it?&rdquo; said Snooks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you,&rdquo; said Locust; &ldquo;in law
a man slanders you if he insinuates that you are dishonest; now
what <!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>does this Bumpkin do? he says &lsquo;you don&rsquo;t
have me,&rsquo; meaning thereby that you don&rsquo;t trick him
out of his pig; and, &lsquo;you are not selling coals,&rsquo;
meaning that when you do sell coals you do trick people.&nbsp; Do
you see?&mdash;that you cheat them, in fact rob them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Snooks thought Mr. Locust the most wonderful man he had ever
come across.&nbsp; This was quite a new way of putting it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But ur didn&rsquo;t say as much,&rdquo; he said,
wondering whether that made any difference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly immaterial in law,&rdquo; said Mr. Locust:
&ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t what a man says, it&rsquo;s what he
<i>means</i>: you put that in by an innuendo&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A what, sir? begging pardon&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s what we lawyers call an innuendo: that is to
say, making out that a man says so and so when he
doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I zee,&rdquo; said the artful Snooks, quick at
apprehending every point.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then if he called a chap a
devilish honest man and the innu&mdash;what d&rsquo;ye call it,
meant he were a thief, you got him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Locust, smiling, &ldquo;that is
going rather far, Mr. Snooks, but I see you understand what I
mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thinks so, sir.&nbsp; I thinks I has your
meanin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very gross slander,&rdquo; observed Mr.
Locust, &ldquo;and especially upon a tradesman in your
position.&nbsp; I suppose now you have lived in the neighbourhood
a considerable time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All my life, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! just so, just so&mdash;now let me see; and, if I
remember rightly, you have a vote for the County.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ave, sir, and allus votes blue, and that&rsquo;s
moore.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re on our side.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
very glad indeed to hear that; a vote&rsquo;s a vote, you know,
now-a-days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Any one would have thought, to hear Mr. Locust, that votes
were scarce commodities, whereas we know that they are among the
most plentiful articles of commerce as well as the cheapest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you have, I think, a family, Mr. Snooks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four on em, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! how very nice, how laudable to make a little
provision for them: as I often say, if a man can only leave his
children a few hundreds apiece, it&rsquo;s something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The solicitor watched his client&rsquo;s face as he uttered
this profound truism, and the face being as open and genuine as
was Snooks&rsquo; character, it said plainly enough &ldquo;Yes, I
have a few hundreds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; continued Mr. Locust, &ldquo;having
been in business all these years, and being, as times go,
tolerably successful, being a careful man, and having got
together by honest industry a nice little
independency&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the learned gentleman paused, and here, unfortunately,
Snooks&rsquo; open and candid heart revealed itself through his
open and candid countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>believe</i>,&rdquo; said Mr. Locust, &ldquo;I am
right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re about right, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very charming, very gratifying to one&rsquo;s
feelings,&rdquo; continued Mr. Locust; &ldquo;and then, just as
you are beginning to get comfortable and getting your family
placed in the world, here comes this what shall I call him, I
never like to use strong language, this intolerable blackguard,
and calls you a thief&mdash;a detestable thief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he didn&rsquo;t use that air word, sir&mdash;I
wool say that,&rdquo; said Mr. Snooks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In law he did, my good man&mdash;he meant it and said
<!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>it&mdash;he insinuated that you cheated the
poor&mdash;you serve a good many of the poor, I think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he insinuated that you cheated them by giving
short weight and bad coals&mdash;that is worse than being a
thief, to my mind&mdash;such a man deserves hanging.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn him,&rdquo; said Snooks, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s it,
is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, my dear sir, smooth it over as you
will.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want to make more of it than necessary,
but we must look at it fairly and study the consequences.&nbsp;
Now I want to ask you particularly, because we must claim special
damage for this, if possible&mdash;have you lost any customers
through this outrageous slander?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say I have, rightly, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but you will&mdash;mark my words, as soon as people
hear of this they will cease to deal with you.&nbsp; They
can&rsquo;t deal with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope not, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I; but let me tell Mr. Bumpkin&rdquo; (here the
learned man shook his forefinger as though it had been the often
quoted finger of scorn) &ldquo;that for every customer you lose
we&rsquo;ll make him answerable in damages.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll
repeat this slander: take my advice and get some one to look out,
and make a note of it&mdash;be on your guard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Snooks wiped the perspiration from his forehead and then threw
his large coloured handkerchief into his hat, which he held by
both hands between his knees,</p>
<p>&ldquo;It be a bad case then, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very bad case for Bumpkin!&rdquo; replied Mr. Locust;
&ldquo;let me have a list of your customers as soon as you can,
and we shall see who leaves you in consequence of this
slander.&nbsp; Does my friend, Mr. Overrighteous, deal with
you?&nbsp; I think he does?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>&ldquo;He do, sir, and have for five or six
years&mdash;and a good customer he be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! now, there&rsquo;s a man!&nbsp; Whatever you do
don&rsquo;t let Mr. Overrighteous know of it: he would leave you
directly: a more particular man than that can&rsquo;t be.&nbsp;
Then again, there is my friend Flythekite, does he deal with
you?&nbsp; Of course he does!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll lose him&mdash;sure to lose
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judging from Mr. Snooks&rsquo; countenance it would have been
small damage if he did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ve-ry well,&rdquo; continued Locust, after a pause,
&ldquo;ve-ry well&mdash;just so.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he looked at
the copy of the writ and perceived that it was dated eighteen
hundred and ninety something instead of eighteen hundred and
seventy something.&nbsp; So he said that the writ was wrong and
they ought not to appear; &ldquo;by which means,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;we shall let them in at the start for a lot of
costs&mdash;we shall let them in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And will that stash the action?&rdquo; asked
Snooks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will not stash ours,&rdquo; said Locust.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I suppose you mean to go on whether he does or not?&nbsp;
Your claim is for assault and slander.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you please, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, as you please.&nbsp; I have not been called a
thief&mdash;they haven&rsquo;t said that I sell short weight and
cheat and defraud the poor: <i>my</i> business will not be
ruined&mdash;<i>my</i> character is not at stake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let un have it, sir; he be a bad un,&rdquo; and here he
rose to depart.&nbsp; Mr. Locust gave him a professional shake of
the hand and wished him good day.&nbsp; But as the door was just
about to be closed on his client, he remembered <!-- page 43--><a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>something
which he desired to ask, so he called, &ldquo;Mr.
Snooks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the client.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there any truth in the statement that this Bumpkin
beats his wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doant rightly know,&rdquo; said Snooks, in a
hesitating voice; &ldquo;it may be true.&nbsp; I shouldn&rsquo;t
wonder&mdash;he&rsquo;s just the sort o&rsquo; man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just enquire about that, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wool, sir,&rdquo; said Snooks; and thus his interview
with his Solicitor terminated.</p>
<p>Now the result of the enquiries as to the domestic happiness
of Bumpkin was this; first, the question floated about in a vague
sort of form, &ldquo;<i>Does Bumpkin beat his wife</i>?&rdquo;
then it grew into &ldquo;<i>Have you heard that Bumpkin beats his
wife</i>?&rdquo; and lastly, it was affirmed that Bumpkin
&ldquo;<i>really did beat his wife</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the
scandal spread so rapidly that it soon reached the ears of
plaintiff himself, who would have treated it with the contempt it
deserved, knowing the quarter whence it came, but that it was so
gross a calumny that he determined to give the lying Snooks no
quarter, and to press his action with all the energy at his
command.</p>
<p>After this there could be no compromise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; said Snooks to himself, as he smoked his
pipe that evening, &ldquo;I could a worked one o&rsquo; them
there innerenders in my trade&mdash;I could a made summut on
him.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Showing how the greatest wisdom of Parliament
may be thrown away on ungrateful people.</p>
<p>The first skirmish between the two doughty champions of the
hostile forces took place over the misdated writ.&nbsp; Judgment
was signed for want of appearance; and then came a summons to set
it aside.&nbsp; The Judge set it aside, and the Divisional Court
set aside the Judge, and the Court of Appeal set aside the
Divisional Court upon the terms of the defendant paying the
costs, and the writ being amended, &amp;c. &amp;c.&nbsp; And I
saw that when the Judge in Chambers had hesitatingly and
&ldquo;not without grave doubt&rdquo; set aside the judgment, Mr.
Prigg said to Mr. Locust, &ldquo;What a very nice
point!&rdquo;&nbsp; And Mr. Locust replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very nice point, indeed!&nbsp; Of course you&rsquo;ll
appeal?&rdquo;&nbsp; And Mr. Quibbler, Mr. Locust&rsquo;s
pleader, said, &ldquo;A very neat point!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear, yes,&rdquo; answered Mr. Prigg.</p>
<p>And then Mr. Prigg&rsquo;s clerk said to Mr. Locust&rsquo;s
clerk&mdash;&ldquo;What a very nice point!&rdquo;&nbsp; And Mr.
Locust&rsquo;s clerk rejoined that it was indeed a very nice
point!&nbsp; And then Mr. Locust&rsquo;s boy in the office said
to Mr. Prigg&rsquo;s boy in the office, &ldquo;What a very nice
point!&rdquo;&nbsp; And Mr. Prigg&rsquo;s boy, a pale tall lad of
about five feet six, and of remarkably quiet demeanour,
replied&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dam nice point!&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>Next came letters from the respective Solicitors,
suggesting a compromise in such terms that compromise became
impossible; each affirming that he was so averse from litigation
that almost any amicable arrangement that could be come to would
be most welcome.&nbsp; Each required a sum of two hundred pounds
and an apology in six morning papers.&nbsp; And I saw at the foot
of one of Mr. Prigg&rsquo;s letters, when the hope of compromise
was nearly at an end, these touching words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bumpkin&rsquo;s blood&rsquo;s up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And at the end of the answer thereto, this very expressive
retort:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say Bumpkin&rsquo;s blood is up; so is
Snooks&rsquo;&mdash;do your worst!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I desire to inform the lay reader as to the interesting
course an action may take under the present expeditious mode of
procedure, I must now state what I saw in my dream.&nbsp; The
course is sinuosity itself in appearance, but that only renders
it the more beautiful.&nbsp; The reader will be able to judge for
himself of the simple method by which we try actions nowadays,
and how very delightful the procedure is.&nbsp; The first
skirmish cost Snooks seventeen pounds six shillings and
eight-pence.&nbsp; It cost Bumpkin only three pounds seventeen
shillings, or <i>one heifer</i>.&nbsp; Now commenced that
wonderful process called &ldquo;Pleading,&rdquo; which has been
the delight and the pride of so many ages; developing gradually
century by century, until at last it has perfected itself into
the most beautiful system of evasion and duplicity that the world
has ever seen.&nbsp; It ranks as one of the fine Arts with Poetry
and Painting.&nbsp; A great Pleader is truly a great Artist, and
more imaginative than any other.&nbsp; The number of summonses at
Chambers is only <!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>limited by his capacity to invent
them.&nbsp; Ask any respectable solicitor how many honest claims
are stifled by proceedings at Chambers.&nbsp; And if I may
digress in all sincerity for the purpose of usefulness, I may
state that while recording my dream for the Press, Solicitors
have begged of me to bring this matter forward, so that the
Public may know how their interests are played with, and their
rights stifled by the iniquitous system of proceedings at
Chambers.</p>
<p>The Victorian age will be surely known as the Age of Pleading,
Poetry, and Painting.</p>
<p>First, the Statement of Claim.&nbsp; Summons at Chambers to
plead and demur; summons to strike out; summons to let in;
summons to answer, summons not to answer; summonses for all sorts
of conceivable and inconceivable objects; summonses for no
objects at all except costs.&nbsp; And let me here say Mr. Prigg
and Mr. Locust are not alone blameable for this: Mr. Quibbler,
Mr. Locust&rsquo;s Pleader, had more to do with this than the
Solicitor himself.&nbsp; And so had Mr. Wrangler, the Pleader of
Mr. Prigg.&nbsp; But without repeating what I saw, let the reader
take this as the line of proceeding throughout, repeated in at
least a dozen instances:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">The Judge at Chambers reversed the Master;</p>
<p class="poetry">The Divisional Court reversed the Judge;</p>
<p class="poetry">And the Court of Appeal reversed the Divisional
Court.</p>
<p>And let this be the chorus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;What a very nice point!&rdquo; said
Prigg;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;What a very nice point!&rdquo; said
Locust;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;What a very nice point!&rdquo; said
Gride (Prigg&rsquo;s clerk);</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;What a d--- nice point!&rdquo; said
Horatio! (the pale boy).</p>
<p class="poetry"><!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>Summons for
particulars.&mdash;Chorus.</p>
<p class="poetry">Further and better
particulars.&mdash;Chorus.</p>
<p class="poetry">Interrogatories&mdash;Summons to strike
out.&mdash;Chorus.</p>
<p class="poetry">Summons for further and better
answers.&mdash;Chorus.</p>
<p class="poetry">More summonses for more, further, better, and
all sorts of things.&mdash;Chorus.</p>
<p>All this repeated by the other side, of course; because each
has his proper innings.&nbsp; There is great fairness and
impartiality in the game.&nbsp; Something was always going up
from the foot of this Jacob&rsquo;s ladder called &ldquo;the
Master&rdquo; to the higher regions called the Court of
Appeal.&nbsp; The simplest possible matter, which any old
laundress of the Temple ought to have been competent to decide by
giving both the parties a box on the ear, was taken before the
Master, from the Master to the Judge, from the Judge to the
Divisional Court, and from the Divisional Court to the Court of
Appeal, at the expense of the unfortunate litigants; while
Judges, who ought to have been engaged in disposing of the
business of the country, were occupied in deciding legal quibbles
and miserable technicalities.&nbsp; All this I saw in my
dream.&nbsp; Up and down this ladder Bumpkin and Snooks were
driven&mdash;one going up the front while the other was coming
down the back.&nbsp; And I heard Bumpkin ask if he wasn&rsquo;t
entitled to the costs which the Court gave when he won.&nbsp; But
the answer of Mr. Prigg was, &ldquo;No, my dear sir, the labourer
is worthy of his hire.&rdquo;&nbsp; And I saw a great many more
ups and downs on the ladder which I should weary the reader by
repeating: they are all alike equally useless and equally
contemptible.&nbsp; Then I thought that poor Bumpkin went up the
ladder with a great bundle on his back; and his face seemed quite
<!-- page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>changed, so that I hardly knew him, and I said to
Horatio, the pale boy&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is that going up now?&nbsp; It looks like Christian
in the Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Horatio, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s old
Bumpkin&mdash;it&rsquo;s a regler sweater for him, ain&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said, &ldquo;Whatever can it be? will he ever reach the
top?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Bumpkin seemed to slip, and it almost took my breath
away; whereat the pale boy laughed, stooping down as he laughed,
and thrusting his hands into his breeches pockets,</p>
<p>&ldquo;By George!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;what a jolly
lark!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope he won&rsquo;t fall,&rdquo; I exclaimed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What has he got on his back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A <span class="smcap">demurrer</span>,&rdquo; said
Horatio, laughing.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look at him!&nbsp; That there
ladder&rsquo;s the Judicatur Act: don&rsquo;t it reach a
height?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s as many rounds in that there ladder
as would take a man a lifetime to go up if it was all spread out;
it&rsquo;s just like them fire escapes in reaching up, but nobody
ever escapes by it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will break the poor man&rsquo;s back,&rdquo; said I,
as he was a few feet from the top.&nbsp; And then in my dream I
thought he fell; and the fright was so great that I awoke, and
found I was sitting in my easy chair by the fire, and the pipe I
had been smoking had fallen out of my hand.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been dreaming,&rdquo; said my wife;
&ldquo;and I fear have had a nightmare.&rdquo;&nbsp; When I was
thoroughly aroused, and had refilled my pipe, I told her all my
dream.</p>
<p><!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>Then cried she, &ldquo;I hope good Mr. Bumpkin will get
up safely with that great bundle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;whether
he do or not; he will have to bear its burden, whether he take it
up or bring it back.&nbsp; He will have to bring it down again
after showing it to the gentlemen at the top.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do they want to see it for?&rdquo; cried she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have no wish to see it,&rdquo; I replied;
&ldquo;on the contrary, they would rather not.&nbsp; They will
simply say he is a very foolish man for his pains to clamber up
so high with so useless a burden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why don&rsquo;t they check him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because they have no power; they look and wonder at the
folly of mankind, who can devise no better scheme of amusement
for getting rid of their money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the lawyers are wise people, and they should know
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lawyers,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;do know better; and
all respectable lawyers detest the complicated system which
brings them more abuse than fees.&nbsp; They see men, permitted
by the law, without character and conscience, bring disgrace on
an honourable body of practitioners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But do they not remonstrate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do, but with little effect; no one knows who is
responsible for the mischief or how to cure it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but the time will come when the people will insist
on a cheaper and more expeditious system.&nbsp; Half-a-dozen
solicitors and members of the junior bar could devise such a
system in a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why are they not permitted to take it in
hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;Old Fogeyism has,
at present, only got the gout in one leg; wait till he has it in
both, and then Common Sense will rise to the occasion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what,&rdquo; quoth she, &ldquo;is this fine art you
spoke of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pleading!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; in what consists its great art?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In artfulness,&rdquo; quoth I.</p>
<p>Then there was a pause, and at length I said, &ldquo;I will
endeavour to give you an illustration of the process of pleading
from ancient history: you have heard, I doubt not, of Joseph and
his Brethren.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, to be sure,&rdquo; cried she; &ldquo;did they not
put him in the pit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I believe they put him in the pit, but I am not
referring to that.&nbsp; The corn in Egypt is what I
mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When they found all their money in their sacks&rsquo;
mouths?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly.&nbsp; Now if Joseph had prosecuted those men
for stealing the money, they would simply have pleaded not
guilty, and the case would have been tried without any bother,
and the defendants have been acquitted or convicted according to
the wisdom of the judge, the skill of the counsel, and the common
sense of the jury.&nbsp; But now suppose instead thereof, Joseph
had brought an action for the price of the corn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would it not have been as simple?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall see.&nbsp; The facts would have been stated
with some accuracy and a good deal of inaccuracy, and a good many
things which were not facts would have been introduced.&nbsp;
Then the defendants in their statement of defence would have
denied that there was any such place <!-- page 52--><a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>as Egypt as
alleged; <a name="citation52"></a><a href="#footnote52"
class="citation">[52]</a> denied that Pharaoh was King thereof;
denied that he had any corn to sell; denied that the said Joseph
had any authority to sell; denied that they or any of them went
into Egypt; denied that they ever saw the said Joseph or had any
communication with him whatever, either by means of an
interpreter or otherwise; denied, in fact, everything except
their own existence; but in the alternative they would go on to
say, if it should be proved that there was a place called Egypt,
a man called Pharaoh, an agent of his called Joseph, and that the
defendants actually did go to Egypt, all of which they one and
all absolutely deny (as becomes men of honour), then they say,
that being large corn-merchants and well known to the said
Joseph, the factor of the said Pharaoh, as purchasers only of
corn for domestic purposes, and requiring therefore a good sound
merchantable article, the said Joseph, by falsely and
fraudulently representing that certain corn of which he, the said
Joseph, was possessed, was at that time of a good sound and
merchantable quality and fit for seed and domestic purposes, by
the said false and fraudulent representations he, the said
Joseph, induced the defendants to purchase a large quantity
thereof, to wit, five thousand sacks; whereas the said corn was
not of a good sound and merchantable quality and fit for seed and
domestic purposes, but was maggoty from damp, and infected with
smut and altogether worthless, as he, the said Joseph, well knew
at the time he made the said false representations.&nbsp; The
defendants would also further allege <!-- page 53--><a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>that, relying
on the said Joseph&rsquo;s word, they took away the said corn,
but having occasion at the inn to look into the said sacks, they
found that the said wheat was worthless, and immediately
communicated with the said Joseph by sending their younger
brother Simeon down to demand a return of the price of the said
corn.&nbsp; But when the said Simeon came to the said Joseph the
said Joseph caught him, and kicked him, and beat him with a great
stick, and had him to prison, and would not restore him to his
brethren, the defendants.&nbsp; Whereupon the defendants sent
other messengers, and at length, after being detained a long time
at the said inn, the said Joseph came down, and on being shown
the said corn, admitted that it was in bad condition.&nbsp;
Whereupon the defendants, fearing to trust the said Joseph with
the said sacks until they had got a return of their said money,
demanded that he, the said Joseph, should put the full tale of
every man&rsquo;s money in the sack of the said man; which thing
the said Joseph agreed to, and placed every man&rsquo;s money in
the mouth of his said sack.&nbsp; And when the said man was about
to reach forth his hand to take his said money, the said Joseph
seized the said hand and held him fast&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop, stop!&rdquo; cried my wife; &ldquo;the said
Joseph had not ten hands.&nbsp; You must surely draw the line
somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that is good pleading; if
the other side should omit to deny it, it will be taken by the
rules of pleading to be admitted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But surely you can&rsquo;t admit
impossibilities!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you, though!&rdquo; cried I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You can do almost anything in pleading.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except, it seems to me, tell the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t be too hard upon us poor
juniors,&rdquo; cried I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t come to the
Counterclaim yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O don&rsquo;t let us have Counterclaims,&rdquo; quoth
she; &ldquo;they can have no claim against Joseph?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, not for selling them smutty wheat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say yes; and he&rsquo;ll have to call a number of
witnesses to prove the contrary&mdash;nor do I think he will be
able to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fail now,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;to see how this
pleading is a fine art.&nbsp; Really, without joking, what is the
art?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The art of pleading,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;consists in
denying what is, and inducing your adversary to admit what
isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

55</span>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Showing that appropriateness of time and place
should be studied in our pastimes.</p>
<p>The next night, sitting over the cheerful fire and comfortably
resting after the labours of the day, I dreamed again, and I saw
that Horatio Snigger was &ldquo;the Office Boy&rdquo; of Mr.
Prigg.&nbsp; He had been in the employment of that gentleman
about two years.&nbsp; He was tall for his money, standing, in
his shoes, at least five feet six, and receiving for his
services, five shillings and sixpence a week, (that is, a
shilling for every foot and a penny for every odd inch), his last
rise (I mean in money,) having taken place about a month ago.</p>
<p>Horatio was a lad of as much spirit as any boy I ever
saw.&nbsp; I do not believe he had any liking for the profession,
but had entered it simply as his first step in life, utterly in
the dark as to whither it would lead him.&nbsp; It was, I
believe, some disappointment to his father that on no occasion
when he interrogated him as to his &ldquo;getting on,&rdquo;
could he elicit any more cheering reply than &ldquo;very
well.&rdquo;&nbsp; And yet Horatio, during the time he had been
with Mr. Prigg, had had opportunities of studying character in
its ever-varying phases as presented by Courts of Justice and
kindred places.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kindred places!&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes, I mean
&ldquo;Judges&rsquo; Chambers,&rdquo; where any boy may speedily
be impressed with the <!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>dignity and simplicity of the
practice of the Law, especially since the passing of the
Judicature Act.&nbsp; To my lay readers who may wish to know what
&ldquo;Judges&rsquo; Chambers&rdquo; means, I may observe that it
is a place where innumerable proceedings may be taken for
lengthening a case, embarrassing the clients, and spending
money.&nbsp; It is, to put it in another form, a sort of Grands
Mulets in the Mont Blanc of litigation, whence, if by the time
you get there you are not thoroughly &ldquo;pumped out,&rdquo;
you may go on farther and in due time reach the top, whence, I am
told, there is a most magnificent view.</p>
<p>But even the beauty of the proceedings at Judges&rsquo;
Chambers failed to impress Horatio with the dignity of the
profession.&nbsp; He lounged among the crowds of chattering boys
and youths who &ldquo;cheeked&rdquo; one another before that
august personage &ldquo;the Master,&rdquo; declaring that
&ldquo;Master&rdquo; couldn&rsquo;t do this and
&ldquo;Master&rdquo; couldn&rsquo;t do that; that the other side
was too late or too soon; that his particulars were too meagre or
too full; or his answers to interrogatories too evasive or not
sufficiently diffuse, and went on generally as if the whole
object of the law were to raise as many difficulties as possible
in the way of its application.&nbsp; As if, in fact, it had
fenced itself in with such an undergrowth of brambles that no
amount of ability and perseverance could arrive at it.</p>
<p>From what I perceived of the character of Horatio, I should
say that he was a scoffer.&nbsp; He was a mild, good-tempered,
well-behaved boy enough, but ridiculed many proceedings which he
ought to have reverenced.&nbsp; He was a great favourite with Mr.
Prigg, because, if anything in the world attracted the
boy&rsquo;s admiration, it was <!-- page 57--><a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>that
gentleman&rsquo;s pious demeanour and profound knowledge.&nbsp;
But the exuberance of the lad&rsquo;s spirits when away from his
employer was in exact proportion to the moral pressure brought to
bear upon him while in that gentleman&rsquo;s presence.&nbsp; As
an illustration of this remark and proof of the twofold character
of Horatio, I will relate what I saw after the
&ldquo;Master&rdquo; had determined that the tail of the 9 was a
very nice point, but that there was nothing in it.&nbsp; They had
all waited a long time at Judge&rsquo;s Chambers, and their
spirits were, no doubt, somewhat elated by at last getting the
matter disposed of.</p>
<p>Horatio heard Mr. Prigg say to Mr. Locust, &ldquo;What a very
nice point!&rdquo; and had heard Mr. Locust reply, &ldquo;A very
nice point, indeed!&rdquo;&nbsp; And Mr. Gride, the clerk, say,
&ldquo;What, a very nice point!&rdquo; and somebody else&rsquo;s
clerk say, &ldquo;What a very nice point!&rdquo;&nbsp; And
Horatio felt, as a humble member of the profession, he must chime
in with the rest of the firm.&nbsp; So, having said to
Locust&rsquo;s boy, &ldquo;What a dam nice point!&rdquo; he went
back to his lonely den in Bedford Row and then, as he termed it,
&ldquo;let himself out.&rdquo;&nbsp; He accomplished this
proceeding by first taking off his coat and throwing it on to a
chair; he next threw but his arms, with his fists firmly
clenched, as though he had hardly yet to its fullest extent
realized the &ldquo;<i>niceness</i>&rdquo; of the point which the
Master had determined.&nbsp; The next step which Horatio took was
what is called &ldquo;The double shuffle,&rdquo; which, I may
inform my readers, is the step usually practised by the gentleman
who imitates the sailor in the hornpipe on the stage.&nbsp; Being
a slim and agile youth, Horatio&rsquo;s performance was by no
means contemptible, except that it was no part of his
professional duty to dance a Hornpipe.&nbsp; <!-- page 58--><a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>Then I saw
that this young gentleman in the exuberance of his youthful
spirits prepared for another exhibition of his talent.&nbsp; He
cleared his throat, once more threw out his arms, stamped his
right foot loudly on the floor, after the manner of the Ethiopian
dancer with the long shoe, and then to my astonishment poured
forth the following words in a very agreeable, and, as it seemed
to me, melodious voice,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;What a very nice point, said
Prigg.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then came what I suppose would be called a few bars of the
hornpipe; then he gave another line,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;What a very nice point, said
Gride.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Another part of the hornpipe.)&nbsp; Then he sang the third
and fourth lines, dancing vigorously the while:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It will take a dozen lawyers with their
everlasting jaw:<br />
It will take a dozen judges with their ever changing
law&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Vigorous dancing for some moments), and then a pause, during
which Horatio, slightly stooping, placed two fingers of his left
hand to the side of his nose, and turning his eyes to the right,
sang&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paused again, and finished vehemently as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Twenty golden guineas to decide!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then came the most enthusiastic hornpipe that ever was seen,
and Horatio was in the seventh Heaven of delight, when the door
suddenly opened, and Mr. Prigg entered!</p>
<p><!-- page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>It was unfortunate for Horatio that his back being
towards the door he could not see his master enter; and it need
scarcely be said that the noise produced by the dance prevented
him from hearing his approach.</p>
<p>Mr. Prigg looked astounded at the sight that presented
itself.&nbsp; The whole verse was repeated, and the whole dance
gone through again in the sight and hearing of that
gentleman.&nbsp; Was the boy mad?&nbsp; Had the strain of
business been too much for him?</p>
<p>As if by instinct Horatio at last became aware of his
master&rsquo;s presence.&nbsp; A change more rapid,
transformation more complete I never saw.&nbsp; The lad hung his
head, and wandered to the chair where his coat was lying.&nbsp;
It took him some time to put it on, for the sleeves seemed
somehow to be twisted; at length, once more arrayed, and
apparently in his right mind, he stood with three-quarter face
towards his astonished master.</p>
<p>Mr. Prigg did not turn his head even on this occasion.&nbsp;
He preserved a dignified silence for some time, and then spoke in
a deep tragic tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horatio!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Horatio did hot answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the meaning of this exhibition,
Horatio?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was only having a little fun, sir,&rdquo; said the
youthful clerk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not averse to youth enjoying itself,&rdquo; said
Mr. Prigg; &ldquo;but it must be at proper seasons, and in
appropriate places; there is also to be exercised a certain
discretion in the choice of those amusements in which youth
should indulge.&nbsp; I am not aware what category of recreation
your present exhibition may belong to, but I may inform you that
in my humble judgment&mdash;I may be mistaken, and you may know
far better than I&mdash;but <!-- page 60--><a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>as at present
advised, I do not see that your late performance is consistent
with the duties of a solicitor&rsquo;s clerk.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
then he muttered to himself, &ldquo;Quite so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this magnificent rebuke, Mr. Prigg drew out his cambric
handkerchief, and most gently applied it to his stately nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again,&rdquo; said Mr. Prigg, &ldquo;I heard language,
or thought I heard language, which I should construe as decidedly
derogatory to the Profession which you serve and to which I have
the honour to belong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was only in fun, sir,&rdquo; said Horatio, gathering
confidence as Mr. Prigg proceeded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so, quite so; that may be, I sincerely hope you
were; but never make fun of that by which you live; you derive
what I may call a very competent, not to say handsome, salary
from the proceedings which you make fun of.&nbsp; This is sad,
and manifests a spirit of levity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean it like that, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the good man, &ldquo;I am glad
to perceive that you are brought to a proper sense of the
impropriety of your conduct.&nbsp; I will not discharge you on
this occasion, for the sake of your father, whom I have known for
so many years: but never let this occur again.&nbsp; Dancing is
at all times, to my mind, a very questionable amusement; but when
it is accompanied, as I perceived it was on this occasion, with
gestures which I cannot characterize by any other term than
disgusting; and when further you take the liberty of using my
name in what I presume you intended for a comic song, I must
confess that I can hardly repress my feelings of
indignation.&nbsp; I hope you are penitent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Horatio hung down his head, and said he was very <!-- page
61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>sorry
Mr. Prigg had heard it, for he only intended it for his own
amusement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall take care,&rdquo; said Mr. Prigg, &ldquo;that
you have less opportunity for such exercises as I have
unfortunately witnessed.&rdquo;&nbsp; And having thus admonished
the repentant youth, Mr. Prigg left him to his reflections.&nbsp;
I am glad Mr. Prigg did not return while the pale boy was
reflecting.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">The pleasure of a country drive on a summer
evening described as enhanced by a pious mind.</p>
<p>It is only fair to the very able solicitors on both sides in
the memorable case of <i>Bumpkin</i> v. <i>Snooks</i> to state
that the greatest possible despatch was exercised on all
occasions.&nbsp; Scarcely a day passed without something being
done, as Prigg expressed it, &ldquo;to expedite
matters.&rdquo;&nbsp; Month after month may have passed away
without any apparent advance; but this in reality was not the
case.&nbsp; Many appeals on what seemed trifling matters had been
heard; so many indeed that <i>Bumpkin</i> v. <i>Snooks</i> had
become a household word with the Court of Appeal, and a bye-word
among the innumerable loafers about Judge&rsquo;s Chambers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&nbsp; <i>Bumpkin</i> v. <i>Snooks</i>
again!&rdquo; the President would say.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is it
now?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a pity the parties to this case can&rsquo;t
agree: it seems a very trifling matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so, my lord, as your lordship will quickly
apprehend when the new point is brought before your notice.&nbsp;
A question of principle is here which may form a precedent for
the guidance of future Judges, as did the famous case of
<i>Perryman</i> v. <i>Lister</i>, which went to the House of
Lords about prosecuting a man for stealing a <!-- page 64--><a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>gun.&nbsp;
This is about a pig, my lord&mdash;a little pig, no doubt, and
although there is not much in the pig, there is a good deal
outside it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And often did Prigg say to Locust:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Locust, whenever <i>shall</i> we be ready to set
this case down for trial?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, my dear Prigg,&rdquo; Locust would reply,
&ldquo;it seems interminable&mdash;come and dine with
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; So the gentle and innocent reader will at once
perceive that there was great impatience on all sides to get this
case ready for trial.&nbsp; Meanwhile it may not be uninteresting
to describe shortly some of the many changes that had taken place
in the few short months since the action commenced.</p>
<p>First it was clearly observable by the inhabitants of Yokelton
that Mr. Prigg&rsquo;s position had considerably improved.&nbsp;
I say nothing of his new hat; that was a small matter, but not so
his style of living&mdash;so great an advance had that made that
it attracted the attention of the neighbours, who often remarked
that Mr. Prigg seemed to be getting a large practice.&nbsp; He
was often seen with his lady on a summer afternoon taking the air
in a nice open carriage&mdash;hired, it is true, for the
occasion.&nbsp; And everybody remarked how uncommonly ladylike
Mrs. Prigg lay back in the vehicle, and how very gracefully she
held her new &aelig;sthetic parasol.&nbsp; And what a proud
moment it was for Bumpkin, when he saw this good and respectable
gentleman pass with the ladylike creature beside him; and Mr.
Bumpkin would say to his neighbours, lifting his hat at the same
moment,</p>
<p>&ldquo;That be my loryer, that air be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then Mr. Prigg would gracefully raise his hat, and Mrs.
Prigg would lie back perfectly motionless as <!-- page 65--><a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>became a very
languid lady of her exalted position.&nbsp; And when Mr. Prigg
said to Mrs. Prigg, &ldquo;My dear, that is our new
client;&rdquo; Mrs. Prigg would elevate her arched eyebrows and
expand her delicate nostrils as she answered,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, my love, what a very vulgar-looking
creechar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not nearly so vulgar as Locust&rsquo;s client,&rdquo;
rejoined her husband.&nbsp; &ldquo;You should see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, my love, it is quite enough to catch a
glimpse of the superior person of the two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Prigg seemed to think it a qualifying circumstance that
Snooks was a more vulgar-looking man than Bumpkin, whereas a
moment&rsquo;s consideration showed Mrs. Prigg how illogical that
was.&nbsp; It is the intrinsic and personal value that one has to
measure things by.&nbsp; This value could not be heightened by
contrast.&nbsp; Mrs. Prigg&rsquo;s curiosity, however, naturally
led her to inquire who the other creechar was?&nbsp; As if she
had never heard of <i>Bumpkin</i> v. <i>Snooks</i>, although she
had actually got the case on four wheels and was riding in it at
that very moment; as if in fact she was not practically all
Bumpkin, as a silkworm may be said to be all mulberry
leaves.&nbsp; As if she knew nothing of her husband&rsquo;s
business!&nbsp; Her ideas were not of this world.&nbsp; Give her
a church to build, she&rsquo;d harass people for subscriptions;
or let it be a meeting to clothe the naked savage, Mrs. Prigg
would be there.&nbsp; She knew nothing of clothing Bumpkin!&nbsp;
But she did interest herself sufficiently in her husband&rsquo;s
conversation to ask, in answer to his reference to Locust&rsquo;s
disreputable client,</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who is he, pray?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>&ldquo;My darling,&rdquo; said Prigg, &ldquo;you must
have heard of Snooks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; drawled Mrs. Prigg, &ldquo;do you mean the
creechar who sells coals?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And are you engaged against <i>that</i> man?&nbsp; How
very dreadful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My darling,&rdquo; observed Mr. Prigg, &ldquo;it is not
for us to choose our opponents; nor indeed, for the matter of
that, our clients.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can quite perceive that,&rdquo; returned the lady,
&ldquo;or you would never have chosen such men&mdash;dear
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are like physicians,&rdquo; returned Mr. Prigg,
&ldquo;called in in case of need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the healing virtues of your profession must not be
confined to rich patients,&rdquo; said Mrs. Prigg, in her jocular
manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; was the good man&rsquo;s reply;
&ldquo;justice is as much the right of the poor as the
rich&mdash;so is the air we breathe&mdash;so is
everything.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he put his fingers together again,
as was his wont whenever he uttered a philosophical or moral
platitude.</p>
<p>So I saw in my dream that the good man and his ladylike wife
rode through the beautiful lanes, and over the breezy common on
that lovely summer afternoon, and as they drew up on the summit
of a hill which gave a view of the distant landscape, there was a
serenity in the scene which could only be compared to the
serenity of Mr. Prigg&rsquo;s benevolent countenance; and there
was a calm, deeply, sweetly impressive, which could only be
appreciated by a mind at peace with itself in particular, and
with the world in general.&nbsp; Then came from a neighbouring
wood the clear voice of the cuckoo.&nbsp; It <!-- page 67--><a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>seemed to
sing purposely in honour of the good man; and I fancied I could
see a ravenous hawk upon a tree, abashed at Mr. Prigg&rsquo;s
presence and superior ability; and a fluttering timid lark seemed
to shriek, &ldquo;Wicked bird, live and let live;&rdquo; but it
was the last word the silly lark uttered, for the hawk was upon
him in a moment, and the little innocent songster was crushed in
its ravenous beak.&nbsp; Still the cuckoo sang on in praise of
Mr. Prigg, with now and then a little note for Mrs. Prigg; for
the cuckoo is a very gallant little bird, and Mrs. Prigg was such
a heavenly creature that no cuckoo could be conscious of her
presence without hymning her praise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said Mrs. Prigg, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t it
beautiful?&nbsp; I wonder where cuckoos go to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, my dear!&rdquo; said Prigg, enraptured with the
clear notes and the beautiful scene; but neither of them seemed
to wonder where hawks go to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you hear the echo, love?&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t it
beautiful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>O, yes, it was beautiful!&nbsp; Nature does indeed lift the
soul on a quiet evening from the grovelling occupations of earth
to bask in the genial sunshine of a more spiritual
existence.&nbsp; What was Bumpkin?&nbsp; What was Snooks to a
scene like this?&nbsp; Suddenly the cuckoo ceased.&nbsp;
Wonderful bird!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know whether it was the
presence of the hawk that hushed its voice or the sight of Mr.
Prigg as he stood up in the carriage to take a more extended view
of the prospect; but the familiar note was hushed, and the
evening hymn in praise of the Priggs was over.</p>
<p>So the journey was continued by the beautiful wood of oaks and
chestnuts, along by the hillside from which you could perceive in
the far distance the little stream <!-- page 68--><a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>as it wound
along by meadow and wood and then lost itself beneath the hill
that rose abruptly on the left.</p>
<p>The stream was the symbol of life&mdash;probably
Bumpkin&rsquo;s life; all nature presents similes to a religious
mind.&nbsp; And so the evening journey was continued with ever
awakening feelings of delight and gratitude until they once more
entered their peaceful home.&nbsp; And this brings me to another
consideration which ought not to be passed over with
indifference.</p>
<p>I saw in my dream that a great change had taken place in the
home of the Priggs.&nbsp; The furniture had undergone a
metamorphosis almost so striking that I thought Mr. Prigg must be
a wizard.&nbsp; The gentle reader knows all about Cinderella; but
here was a transformation more surprising.&nbsp; I saw that one
of Mr. Bumpkin&rsquo;s pigs had been turned into a very pretty
walnut-wood whatnot, and stood in the drawing-room, and on it
stood several of the ducks and geese that used to swim in the
pond of Southwood farm.&nbsp; They were not ducks and geese now,
but pretty silent ornaments.&nbsp; An old rough-looking stack of
oats had been turned into a very nice Turkey carpet for the
dining-room.&nbsp; Poor old Jack the donkey had been changed into
a musical box that stood on a little table made out of a
calf.&nbsp; One day Mr. Bumpkin called to see how his case was
going on, and by mistake got into this room among his cows and
pigs; but not one of them did the farmer know, and when the maid
invited him to sit down he was afraid of spoiling something.</p>
<p>Now summonses at Chambers, and appeals, and demurrers, are not
at all bad conjuring wands, if you only know how to use
them.&nbsp; Two clever men like Prigg and Locust, not only
surprise the profession, but alarm the <!-- page 69--><a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>public, since
no one knows what will take place next, and Justice herself is
startled from her propriety.&nbsp; Let no clamorous law reformer
say that interrogatories or any other multitudinous proceedings
at Judge&rsquo;s Chambers are useless.&nbsp; It is astonishing
how many changes you can ring upon them with a little ingenuity,
and a very little scrupulosity.&nbsp; Mr. Prigg turned two sides
of bacon into an Indian vase, and performed many other feats
truly astonishing to persons who look on as mere spectators, and
wonder how it is done.&nbsp; Wave your magic wand, good Prigg,
and you shall see a hayrick turn into a chestnut mare; and a
four-wheeled waggon into a Victoria.</p>
<p>But the greatest change he had effected was in Mr. Bumpkin
himself, who loved to hear his wife read the interrogatories and
answers.&nbsp; The almanac was nothing to this.&nbsp; He had no
idea law was so interesting.&nbsp; I dare say there were two
guiding influences working within him, in addition to the many
influences working without; one being that inherent British
pluck, which once aroused, &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t care, sir, if it
costs me a thousand pound, I&rsquo;ll have it out wi&rsquo;
un;&rdquo; the other was the delicious thought that all his
present outlay would be repaid by the cunning and covetous
Snooks.&nbsp; So much was Bumpkin&rsquo;s heart in the work of
crushing his opponent, that expense was treated with
ridicule.&nbsp; I heard him one day say jocularly to Mr. Prigg,
who had come for an affidavit:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be it a pig, sir, or a heifer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O,&rdquo; said the worthy Prigg, &ldquo;we want a
pretty good one; I think it must be a heifer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this was very pleasant, and made the business, dull and
prosaic in itself, a cheerful recreation.</p>
<p>Then, again, there was a feeling of self-importance <!-- page
70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>whenever these affidavits came to be sworn.&nbsp; Mr.
Bumpkin would put down his ash-stick by the side of the
fireplace, and bidding his visitor be seated, would compose
himself with satisfaction to listen to the oft-repeated
words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, Thomas Bumpkin, make oath, and say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fancy, &ldquo;<i>I</i>, <i>Bumpkin</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; Just let
the reader pause over that for a moment!&nbsp; What must
&ldquo;I, Bumpkin,&rdquo; be whose statement is required on oath
before my Lord Judge?</p>
<p>Always, at these words, he would shout.&nbsp; &ldquo;That be
it&mdash;now then, sir, would you please begin that
agin?&rdquo;&mdash;while, if Mrs. Bumpkin were not too busy, he
would call her in to hear them too.</p>
<p>So there was no wonder that the action went merrily
along.&nbsp; Once get up enthusiasm in a cause, and it is half
won.&nbsp; Without enthusiasm, few causes can succeed against
opposition.&nbsp; Then, again, the affidavit described Bumpkin as
a Yeoman.&nbsp; What, I wonder, would Snooks the coal-merchant
think of that?</p>
<p>So everything proceeded satisfactorily, and the months rolled
away; the seasons came in their turn, so did the crops, so did
the farrows of pigs, so did the spring chickens, and young ducks
(prettiest little golden things in the world, on the water); so
did Mr. Prigg, and so did a gentleman (hereafter to be called
&ldquo;the man,&rdquo;) with whom a very convenient arrangement
was made, by which Mr. Bumpkin preserved the whole of his
remaining stock intact; had not in fact to advance a single penny
piece more; all advances necessary for the prosecution of the
action being made by the strange gentleman (whose name I did not
catch) under that most convenient of all legal forms, &ldquo;a
Bill of Sale.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">A farmhouse winter fireside&mdash;a morning
drive and a mutual interchange of ideas between town and country:
showing how we may all learn something from one another.</p>
<p>I never saw the home of Farmer Bumpkin without thinking what a
happy and comfortable home it was.&nbsp; The old elm tree that
waved over the thatched roof, seemed to bless and protect
it.&nbsp; On a winter&rsquo;s evening, when Bumpkin was sitting
in one corner smoking his long pipe, Mrs. Bumpkin darning her
stockings, and Joe on the other side looking into the blazing
fire, while the old Collie stretched himself in a snug corner
beside his master, it represented a scene of comfort almost as
perfect as rustic human nature was capable of enjoying.&nbsp; And
when the wind blew through the branches of the elm over the roof,
it was like music, played on purpose to heighten the
enjoyment.&nbsp; Comfort, thou art at the evening fireside of a
farm-house, if anywhere!</p>
<p>You should have seen Tim, when an unusual sound disturbed the
harmony of this peaceful fireside.&nbsp; He growled first as he
lay with his head resting between his paws, and just turned up
his eyes to his master for approval.&nbsp; Then, if that warning
was not sufficient, he rose and barked vociferously.&nbsp;
Possessed, I believe, of <!-- page 72--><a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>more insight
than Bumpkin, he got into the most tremendous state of excitement
whensoever anyone came from Prigg&rsquo;s, and he cordially hated
Prigg.&nbsp; But most of all was he angry when &ldquo;the
man&rdquo; came.&nbsp; There was no keeping him quiet.&nbsp; I
wonder if dogs know more about Bills of Sale than farmers.&nbsp;
I am aware that some farmers know a good deal about them; and
when they read this story, many of them will accuse me of being
too personal; but Tim was a dog of strong prejudices, and I am
sure he had a prejudice against money-lenders.</p>
<p>As the persons I have mentioned were thus sitting on this
dreary evening in the month of November, suddenly, Tim sprang
from his recumbent position, and barked furiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down, Tim! down, Tim!&rdquo; said the farmer;
&ldquo;what be this, I wonder!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tim, Tim,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bumpkin, &ldquo;down, Tim!
hold thee noise, I tell ee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Tim!&rdquo; said Joe; he also had an instinct.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll goo and see what it be,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Bumpkin; &ldquo;whoever can come here at this time o&rsquo;
night! it be summat, Tom.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she put down her
stockings, and lighting a candle went to the front door, whereat
there was a loud knocking.&nbsp; Tim jumped and flew and thrust
his nose down to the bottom of the door long before Mrs. Bumpkin
could get there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quiet, Tim!&nbsp; I tell thee; who be there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Mr. Prigg&rsquo;s,&rdquo; answered a voice.</p>
<p>This was enough for Tim; the name of Prigg made him
furious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody from Mr. Prigg, Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wull, let un in, Nance; bless thee soul, let un in; may
be the case be settled.&nbsp; I hope they ain&rsquo;t took less
<!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>nor a hundred pound.&nbsp; I told un not
to.&rdquo;&nbsp; The door was unbolted and unbarred, and a long
time it took, and then stood before Mrs. Bumpkin a tall pale
youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come from Mr. Prigg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will er plase to walk in, sir?&rdquo; said Mrs.
Bumpkin.</p>
<p>By this time the master had got up from his seat, and
advancing towards the youth said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do, sir; how do, sir; wark in, wark in, tak a seat,
I be glad to see thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I come from Mr. Prigg,&rdquo; said the youth,
&ldquo;and we want another affidavit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hem!&rdquo; said Bumpkin, &ldquo;be it a pig or a
eifer, sir?&rdquo;&nbsp; He couldn&rsquo;t forget the old
joke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want an affidavit of documents,&rdquo; said the
youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what be the manin o&rsquo; that?&mdash;affiday
o&rsquo; what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Documents, sir,&rdquo; said the mild youth; &ldquo;here
it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Bumpkin, &ldquo;I got to swear un, I
spoase, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, sir,&rdquo; said Horatio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, thee can&rsquo;t take oaths, I spoase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, not exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wull then I spoase I must goo to --- in the
marnin.&nbsp; And thee&rsquo;ll stop here the night and mak
thyself comfortable.&nbsp; We can gie un a bed, can&rsquo;t us,
Nancy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two, if ur wishes it,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Devil&rsquo;s in it, ur doan&rsquo;t want two beds,
I&rsquo;ll warrant?&nbsp; Now then, sir, sitten doon and mak
theeself comfortable.&nbsp; What&rsquo;ll thee drink?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m too young to drink,&rdquo; said Horatio, with
a smile.</p>
<p>Bumpkin smiled too.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll warrant thee
be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m always too young,&rdquo; said Horatio,
&ldquo;for every thing that&rsquo;s nice.&nbsp; Mr. Prigg says
I&rsquo;m too young to <!-- page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>enjoy myself; but if you don&rsquo;t
mind, sir, I&rsquo;m not too young to be hungry.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
walked a long distance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have ur now?&rdquo; said Mrs. Bumpkin.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
ain&rsquo;t got anything wery grand, sir; but there be a nice
piece o&rsquo; pickle pork and pease-puddin, if thee doan&rsquo;t
mind thic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring un out,&rdquo; said Bumpkin; and accordingly a
nice clean cloth was soon spread, and the table was groaning (as
the saying is), with a large leg of pork and pease-pudding and
home-made bread; to which Horatio did ample justice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bain&rsquo;t bad pooark,&rdquo; said Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Best I ever tasted,&rdquo; replied Horatio; &ldquo;we
don&rsquo;t get this sort of pork in London&mdash;pork there
doesn&rsquo;t seem like pork.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now look at that,&rdquo; said Joe; &ldquo;I fed that
air pig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So ur did, Joe,&rdquo; said the farmer;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll gie thee credit, Joe, thee fed un
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Joe; &ldquo;and that air pig knowed I
as well as I knows thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Horatio had supped, and the things were removed, Mr.
Bumpkin assured the youth that a little drop of gin-and-water
would not hurt him after his journey; and accordingly mixed him a
tumbler.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thee doan&rsquo;t smoke, I spoase?&rdquo;
he said; to which Mrs. Bumpkin added that she &ldquo;spoased he
wur too young like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try,&rdquo; answered the courageous youth,
nothing daunted by his youngness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So thee shall&mdash;dang if thee shan&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
rejoined Mr. Bumpkin; and produced a long churchwarden pipe, and
a big leaden jar of tobacco of a very dark character, called
&ldquo;shag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Horatio filled his pipe, and puffed away as if he had been a
veteran smoker; cloud after cloud came forth, <!-- page 75--><a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>and when Mr.
and Mrs. Bumpkin and Joe looked, expecting that the boy should be
ill, there was not the least sign; so Joe observed with great
sagacity:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at that now, maister; I bleeve he&rsquo;ve smoked
afoore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have ur, sir?&rdquo; asked Mr. Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little,&rdquo; said Horatio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I never smoked afoore I wur turned twenty,&rdquo;
said the farmer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe the right time now is fourteen,&rdquo;
observed the youth; &ldquo;it used to be twenty, I have heard
father say; but everything has been altered by the Judicature
Act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at that air,&rdquo; said Joe, &ldquo;he&rsquo;ve
eeard father say.&nbsp; You knows a thing or two, I&rsquo;ll
warrant, Mr. &mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Joe was baffled, and coming so abruptly to an end of his
address, Mr. Bumpkin took the matter up, and asked, if he might
make so bold, what the youth&rsquo;s name might be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horatio Snigger,&rdquo; answered that gentleman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When will this ere case be on, think&rsquo;ee,
sir?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We expect it to be in the paper every day now,&rdquo;
said the youth; &ldquo;they&rsquo;ve tried to dodge us a good
deal, but they can&rsquo;t dodge us much longer&mdash;we&rsquo;re
a little too downy for em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It have been a mighty long time about, surely,&rdquo;
said Mr. Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, that&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; said Horatio;
&ldquo;time&rsquo;s nothing in Law!&nbsp; Why, a suit to
administer a Will sometimes takes &rsquo;ears; and Bankruptcy, O
my eye, ain&rsquo;t there dodging about that, and jockeying too,
eh!&nbsp; Crikey!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bumpkin here winked at his wife, as much as to <!-- page
76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>say,
&ldquo;Now you hold your tongue, and see me dror un out.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll have un.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will ee tak a little more gin-and-water,
sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thankee,&rdquo; said the youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little more won&rsquo;t hurt ee&mdash;it&rsquo;ll do
thee good.&rdquo;&nbsp; And again he filled the tumbler; while
the pale boy refilled his pipe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, who&rsquo;s my counsellor gwine to be?&rdquo;
asked the farmer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Horatio, &ldquo;a regular
cruncher&mdash;Mr. Catapult.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He be a cruncher, be he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you; he turned a man inside out the other
day; a money-lender he was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did ur now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at that,&rdquo; said Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;re going to have Mr. Dynamite for junior;
my eye, don&rsquo;t he make a row!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two an em!&rdquo; exclaimed Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must have two for the plaintiff,&rdquo; said Horatio;
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s the law.&nbsp; Why, a Queen&rsquo;s Counsel
ain&rsquo;t allowed to open a case without a junior starts
him&mdash;it&rsquo;s jist like the engine-driver and the
guard.&nbsp; You have the junior to shove the leader.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at that,&rdquo; said Joe; expectorating into the
fire.</p>
<p>Mr. Bumpkin looked again at Nancy, and gave another wink that
you might have heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the tother side?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know about them,&rdquo; said
the boy.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;re artful dodgers, they
are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is &rsquo;em now? but artfulness don&rsquo;t allays
win, do ur?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Horatio; &ldquo;but it goes a
long way, and sometimes when it&rsquo;s gone a long way it beats
itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at that,&rdquo; said Joe; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s like
that ere&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be quiet, Joe,&rdquo; said Bumpkin; &ldquo;let I talk,
will ur?&nbsp; You said it beats itself, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the judge gets &rsquo;old of him, it&rsquo;s sure
to,&rdquo; said Horatio.&nbsp; &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t no judge
on the Bench as will let artfulness win if he knows it.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve sin em watchin like a cat watches a mouse; and
directly it comes out o&rsquo; the &rsquo;ole, down he is on
em&mdash;like that:&rdquo; and he slapped his hand on the table
with startling effect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t they know who the solicitor is,
eh&mdash;that&rsquo;s all!&nbsp; My word, if he&rsquo;s a shady
one&mdash;the judge is down on the case like winkin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And be this ere Locust a shady un?&rdquo;&nbsp;
(Another wink at Mrs. Bumpkin.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m too young to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thee beest too old, thee meanest,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Bumpkin, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now hold thee tongue, Nancy; I wur gwine to say that
myself&mdash;dang if I warnt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now look at thic,&rdquo; said Joe; &ldquo;maister were
gwine to say thic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I wur,&rdquo; repeated Bumpkin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Jist
got the word o&rsquo; th&rsquo; tip o&rsquo; th&rsquo;
tongue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And be these Queen&rsquo;s Counsellors,&rdquo; he
asked, &ldquo;summat grand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you,&rdquo; said Horatio; &ldquo;they wears
silk gowns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do em?&rdquo; said Mrs. Bumpkin, laughing.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Silk gowns&mdash;and what kind o&rsquo;
petticoats?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up,&rdquo; said Bumpkin; &ldquo;thee be as igorant
as a <!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>donkey; these Queen&rsquo;s Counsellors be made for
their larnin and cleverness, beant em, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Horatio, &ldquo;nobody ever could
make out&mdash;some of em are pretty good, and some of em
ain&rsquo;t much&mdash;not near so good as the others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this ere Mr. Catapult be a good un, bean&rsquo;t
he&mdash;a regler crunsher?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, I believe you, my boy: his look&rsquo;s enough for
some of em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I spoase he be dear?&rdquo;&nbsp; (Another wink at Mrs.
Bumpkin.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all dear,&rdquo; said Horatio;
&ldquo;some of em are dear because their fees are high; and some
of em would be dear at a gift, but I&rsquo;m too young to know
much about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now hark at that,&rdquo; said Joe; &ldquo;like that air
old horse o&rsquo; Morris&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold thee tongue, Joe, I tell ee, putten thy spoke in;
does thee think the Queen &rsquo;as old &rsquo;orses in her
stable?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s merit, I tell ee&mdash;ain&rsquo;t it,
Mr. Jigger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Merit, sir; I believe it&rsquo;s merit.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And thus in pleasant conversation the evening passed merrily
away, until the clock striking nine warned the company that it
was time to retire.</p>
<p>A bright, brisk frosty morning succeeded, and a substantial
breakfast of bacon, eggs, fresh butter, and home-made bread, at
seven o&rsquo;clock, somewhat astonished and delighted the
youthful Horatio; and then the old horse, with plenty of hair
about his heels, was brought round with the gig.&nbsp; And Mr.
Bumpkin and his guest got up and took their seats.&nbsp; The old
Market Town was about seven miles off, and the road lay through
the most picturesque scenery of the county.&nbsp; To ride on such
<!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>a pleasant morning through such a country almost made
one think that swearing affidavits was the most pleasing
occupation of life.&nbsp; It was the first time Horatio had ever
ridden in a gig: the horse went a good old market pace, and the
beautiful sunshine, lovely scenery, and crisp air produced in his
youthful bosom a peculiarly charming and delightful sense of
exhilaration.&nbsp; He praised the country and the weather and
the horse, and asked if it was what they called a
thoroughbred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chit!&rdquo; said Bumpkin, &ldquo;thoroughbred!&nbsp;
So be I thoroughbred&mdash;did thee ever see thoroughbred
wi&rsquo; &rsquo;air on his &rsquo;eels?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he goes well,&rdquo; said Horatio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gooes well enough for I,&rdquo; said Bumpkin.</p>
<p>This answer somewhat abashed Horatio, who was unlearned in
horses; for some time he remained silent.&nbsp; Then it became
Mr. Bumpkin&rsquo;s turn to renew the conversation:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I spoase,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;thee be gwine to be a
loryer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if I know it,&rdquo; answered Horatio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t care for it; I like the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What wouldst thee like to be then, a farmer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should&mdash;that&rsquo;s the life for me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thee likes plenty o&rsquo; fresh air?&rdquo; said the
farmer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Horatio, &ldquo;and fresh butter
and fresh eggs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to ---, if thee doen&rsquo;t know
what&rsquo;s good for thee, anyhow.&nbsp; Thee&rsquo;d ha&rsquo;
to work &rsquo;ard to keep straaight, I can tell thee;
thee&rsquo;d had to plough, and danged if I believe thee could
hold plough!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s thee say to that, lad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I could.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>&ldquo;Devil a bit! now spoase thee&rsquo;st got
plough-handles under thy arms, and the cord in the &rsquo;ands,
and thee wanted to keep t&rsquo;colter from jibbin into t&rsquo;
soil, wouldst thee press down wi&rsquo; might and main, or
how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Press down with might and main,&rdquo; said
Horatio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right!&rdquo; exclaimed Bumpkin; &ldquo;danged if I
doant think thee&rsquo;d make a ploughman now.&nbsp; Dost know
what th&rsquo; manin o&rsquo; mither woiy be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was rather a startling question for the unsophisticated
London youth.&nbsp; He had never heard such an expression in his
life; and although he might have puzzled his agricultural
interrogator by a good many questions in return, yet that
possibility was no answer to &ldquo;mither woiy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that, Mr. Bumpkin,&rdquo; he
ingenuously replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No? well, there ain&rsquo;t a commoner word down ere
nor &lsquo;mither woiy,&rsquo; and there ain&rsquo;t a boy arf
your age as doan&rsquo;t know the manin o&rsquo;t, so thee see
thee got summat to larn.&nbsp; Now it mane this&mdash;spoase thee
got a team o&rsquo; horses at dung cart or gravel cart, and thee
wants em to come to ee; thee jest holds whip up over to the ed
o&rsquo; th&rsquo; leadin orse like this ere, and says
&lsquo;mither woiy,&rsquo; and round er comes as natteral as
possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, that&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; said Horatio; &ldquo;I
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Bumpkin, &ldquo;I can teach ee summat,
can&rsquo;t I, though thee comes from town, and I be only a
country clown farmer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should just like to come down a month on trial,
that&rsquo;s all, when I have my holiday,&rdquo; said the youth;
&ldquo;I think it would do me good: &lsquo;mither
woiy,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said, mimicking his instructor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thee shall come if thee likes,&rdquo; replied the
good-natured <!-- page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>Bumpkin; &ldquo;Nancy&rsquo;ll be
proud to see thee&mdash;thee&rsquo;s got &lsquo;mither
woiy&rsquo; to rights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a very nice public-house!&rdquo; exclaimed
Horatio, as they approached a village green where an old Inn that
had flourished in the coaching days still stood, the decaying
monument of a past age, and an almost forgotten style of
locomotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be a good house.&nbsp; I often pulls up there on way
from market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever try rum and milk for your cough?&rdquo;
inquired the pale youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never had no cough,&rdquo; said Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a good thing!&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s capital, they
say, in case you should have one; they say there&rsquo;s nothing
beats rum and milk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hem!&rdquo; muttered Bumpkin, giving his horse a
tremendous jerk with the reins.&nbsp; &ldquo;I spoase
thee&rsquo;d like a glass, Mr. Jigger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care about it for myself,&rdquo; answered
the youth; &ldquo;but if you like to have one I&rsquo;ll join you
with pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So us wool then;&rdquo; and up they pulled at the sign
of the &ldquo;Merry-go-round&rdquo; on Addlehead Green.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bain&rsquo;t bad tackle!&rdquo; said Mr. Bumpkin,
tossing off his glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; responded Horatio, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tasted
worse medicine.&nbsp; I quite enjoy my ride, Mr. Bumpkin; I wish
we had a dozen more affidavits to swear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doan&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the client; &ldquo;I sworn
a goodish many on em as it be.&nbsp; I doan&rsquo;t think that
air Snooks can bate un.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he can,&rdquo; said Horatio, as
they once more climbed into the old-fashioned gig; &ldquo;but
talk <!-- page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>about paper, you should see your brief: that&rsquo;s a
caution and no mistake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is ur now?&nbsp; In what way, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lor, how I should like a cigar, Mr. Bumpkin, if
I&rsquo;d only got my case with me, but
unfortunately&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would ur&mdash;then thee shall &rsquo;ave one; here,
Mr. Ostler, jest goo and fetch one o&rsquo; them there what
d&rsquo;ye call ems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, do they sell them down here?&nbsp;
Cigars&mdash;cigars,&rdquo; said Horatio, &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t
aware of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, sir; what about this ere what d&rsquo;ye call
un&mdash;beef?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bumpkin, being a very artful man, was inwardly chuckling
at the successful man&oelig;uvring by which he was drawing out
this pale unsophisticated London youth, and hoped by dint of a
little strategy to learn a good deal before they parted
company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brief! brief!&rdquo; said Horatio, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! so it wur; thee said he wur a hell of a big
un.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I wrote him myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did ur now; then thee knows all about un?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From beginning to end&mdash;he is a clipper, I can tell
you; a regular whacker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope he&rsquo;ll whack thic Snooks then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a beauty!&rdquo; rejoined Horatio, much to
his companion&rsquo;s surprise; for here was this young man
speaking of a brief in the same terms that he (Bumpkin) would use
with reference to a prize wurzel or swede.&nbsp; A brief being a
<i>beauty</i> sounded somewhat strange in the ears of a farmer
who could associate the term with nothing that didn&rsquo;t grow
on the farm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say you&rsquo;ve heard of Macaulay&rsquo;s
England?&rdquo; asked the lad.</p>
<p><!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>&ldquo;Whose England?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Macaulay&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve eerd o&rsquo; England, if you mean this ere
country, sartainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve heard of Macaulay&rsquo;s History, I
mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say as ever I eerd tell on un.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s as much in your brief as there is
in that book, and that&rsquo;s saying something, ain&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zo&rsquo;t be; but what th&rsquo; devil be &rsquo;t all
about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; said Horatio, holding
out his hands and putting the point of his right forefinger on to
the point of the forefinger of his left hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;First:
biography of the plaintiff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There now,&rdquo; said Bumpkin, shaking the reins;
&ldquo;thee med jist as well talk Greek&mdash;it&rsquo;s the same
wally (value) to me, for I doan&rsquo;t understan&rsquo; a
word&mdash;bography, indade!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, Mr. Bumpkin, there is first a history of
your life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good lord, what be that for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you presently&mdash;then there&rsquo;s
the history of Mrs. Bumpkin from the cradle.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Mr.
Bumpkin uttered an exclamation which nothing shall induce me to
put on paper.)&nbsp; &ldquo;Then&rdquo;&mdash;and here the young
man had reached the third finger of the left
hand&mdash;&ldquo;then comes a history of the defendant
Snooks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Bumpkin, as though they were getting
nearer the mark; &ldquo;that be summut like&mdash;that&rsquo;ll
do un&mdash;have you put in about the gal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked the youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! didn&rsquo;t thee &rsquo;ear?&nbsp; Why, thee
&rsquo;st left out the best part o&rsquo; Snooks&rsquo; life; he
were keepin company wi&rsquo; a gal and left her in t&rsquo;
lurch: but I &rsquo;ope thee &rsquo;st shown <!-- page 84--><a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>up ur carater
well in other ways&mdash;he be the worst man as ever lived in
this &rsquo;ere country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Horatio, travelling towards his
little finger; &ldquo;then there&rsquo;s the history of the
pig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zounds!&rdquo; laughed the farmer, &ldquo;if ever I
eerd tell o&rsquo; such a thing in my bornd days.&nbsp; What the
devil be the good o&rsquo; thic?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, a good deal; the longer you make the brief the more
money you get&mdash;you are paid by the yard.&nbsp; They
don&rsquo;t pay lawyers accordin&rsquo; to the value of their
services, but the length of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, look ee &rsquo;ere, if I sells a pig it
ain&rsquo;t wallied by its length, but by its weight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t so with lawyers then,&rdquo; rejoined
Horatio; &ldquo;the taxing master takes the length of the pig,
and his tail counts, and the longer the tail the better the
taxing master likes it; then comes,&rdquo;&mdash;(as the young
lad had only four fingers he was obliged to have recourse to his
thumb, placing his forefinger thereon)&mdash;&ldquo;then comes
about ten pages on the immortality of the soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That be the tail, I spoase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got it,&rdquo; said Horatio, laughing.&nbsp;
&ldquo;O, he&rsquo;s a stunner on the immortality of the
soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who be?&mdash;Snooks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;Prigg&mdash;he goes into it like
winkin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what be it to do with thic case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you only put in a brief what had got to do
with the case it would be a poor thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I saw in my dream that the young man was speaking
truthfully: it was a beautifully drawn essay on the immortality
of the soul, especially Bumpkin&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By George!&rdquo; continued the youth,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;ll cost something&mdash;that brief.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 85--><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>Mr. Bumpkin twitched as if he had touched with ice a
nerve of his hollow tooth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had the money that case&rsquo;ll cost I
wouldn&rsquo;t do any more work,&rdquo; said the youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would&rsquo;st thee be then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I should try and get an Associate&rsquo;s place
in one of the Courts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hem! but this ere Snooks ull have to pay, won&rsquo;t
he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Horatio, breathing deeply and
indignantly, &ldquo;I hope so; he&rsquo;s a mean cuss&mdash;what
d&rsquo;ye think? never give Locust&rsquo;s boy so much as a
half-sovereign!&nbsp; Now don&rsquo;t such a feller deserve to
lose?&nbsp; And do you think Locust&rsquo;s boy will interest
himself in his behalf?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bumpkin looked slily out of the corners of his eyes at the
young man, but the young man was impassive as stone, and pale as
if made of the best Carrara marble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But tell I, sir&mdash;for here we be at the plaace of
Mr. Commissioner to take oaths&mdash;what need be there o&rsquo;
this ere thing I be gwine to swear, for I&rsquo;ll be danged if I
understand a word of un, so I tell ee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Costs, my dear sir, costs!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>And I heard Bumpkin mutter to himself that &ldquo;he&rsquo;d
he danged if this &rsquo;ere feller wur so young as he made
out&mdash;his &rsquo;ead wur a mighty dale older nor his
body.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 87--><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">The last night before the first London
expedition, which gives occasion to recall pleasant
reminiscences.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, Bumpkin, make oath and say,&rdquo; having been duly
presented, and the Commissioner having duly placed the Testament
in Mr. Bumpkin&rsquo;s hands, and said to him that to the best of
his knowledge and belief the contents of the &ldquo;I
Bumpkin&rdquo; paper were true, the matter was over, and Mr.
Snigger, with the valuable document in his possession, might have
returned to London by the next train.&nbsp; But as Horatio
afterwards observed to a friend, he &ldquo;was not quite so
green.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was market day; Mr. Bumpkin was a genial
companion, and had asked him to partake of the Market
Ordinary.&nbsp; So thither at one o&rsquo;clock they repaired,
and a very fine dinner the pale youth disposed of.&nbsp; It
seemed in proportion to the wonderful brief whose merits they had
previously discussed.&nbsp; More and more did Horatio think that
a farmer&rsquo;s life was the life for him.&nbsp; He had never
seen such &ldquo;feeding;&rdquo; more and more would he like that
month on trial in the country; more and more inclined was he to
throw up the whole blessed law at once and for ever.&nbsp; This
partly-formed resolution he communicated to Mr. Bumpkin, and
assured him that, but for the case of <i>Bumpkin</i> v.
<i>Snooks</i>, he would do so on that very afternoon, and wash
his hands of it.</p>
<p><!-- page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to
leave you in the lurch, Mr. Bumpkin, or else I&rsquo;d cut it at
once, and throw this affidavit into the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; said the farmer, &ldquo;thee beest a
young man, don&rsquo;t do nowt that be wrong&mdash;stick to thy
employer like a man, and when thee leaves, leave like a
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as your case is over, I shall hook it, Mr.
Bumpkin.&nbsp; And now let me see&mdash;you&rsquo;ll have to come
to London in a week or two, for I am pretty nigh sure we shall be
in the paper by that time.&nbsp; I shall see you when you come
up&mdash;where shall you stay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Danged if I know; I be a straanger in
Lunnun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, look &rsquo;ere, Mr. Bumpkin, I can tell you
of a very nice quiet public-house in Westminster where
you&rsquo;ll be at home; the woman, I believe, comes from your
part of the country, and so does the landlord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What be the naame o&rsquo; the public
&rsquo;ouse?&rdquo; asked Mr. Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the sign of the &lsquo;Goose,&rsquo; and
stands just a little way off from the water-side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Goose&rdquo; sounded countryfied and homelike, and
being near the water would be pleasant, and the landlord and
landlady being Somersetshire people would also be pleasant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be it a dear plaace?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no; dirt cheap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that air <i>dirt</i> cheap I doan&rsquo;t
like&mdash;I likes it a bit clean like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, clean as a smelt&mdash;clean as ever it can
be; and I&rsquo;ll bespeak your lodgings for you if you like, and
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, thankee, sir, thankee,&rdquo; said the farmer,
shaking hands with the youth, and giving him a
half-sovereign.&nbsp; <!-- page 89--><a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>&ldquo;I be proud to know
thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; And thus they parted: Horatio returning to his
office, and Mr. Bumpkin driving home at what is called a
&ldquo;shig-shog&rdquo; pace, reflecting upon all the events that
had transpired during that memorable day.</p>
<p>Pretty much the same as ever went on the things at the farm,
and the weeks passed by, and the autumn was over, and Christmas
Day came and went, and the Assizes came and went, and
<i>Bumpkin</i> v. <i>Snooks</i> alone in all the world seemed to
stand still.&nbsp; One day in the autumn a friend of Mr.
Prigg&rsquo;s came and asked the favour of a day&rsquo;s fishing,
which was granted with Mr. Bumpkin&rsquo;s usual
cordiality.&nbsp; He was not only to fish on that day, but to
come whenever he liked, and make the house his &ldquo;hoame,
like.&rdquo;&nbsp; So he came and fished, and partook of the
hospitality of the homely but plentiful table, and enjoyed
himself as often as he pleased.&nbsp; He was a most agreeable
man, and knew how to talk.&nbsp; Understood a good deal about
agriculture and sheep breeding, and quite enjoyed a walk with Mr.
Bumpkin round the farm.&nbsp; This happened five or six times
during the autumn.&nbsp; He was reticent when Mr. Bumpkin
mentioned the lawsuit, because he knew so little about legal
proceedings.&nbsp; Nor could Mr. Bumpkin &ldquo;draw him
out&rdquo; on any point.&nbsp; Nothing could be ascertained
concerning him except that he had a place in Yorkshire, and was
in London on a visit; that he had known Mr. Prigg for a good many
years, and always &ldquo;found him the same.&rdquo;&nbsp; At
last, the month of February came, and the long expected letter
from Mr. Prigg.&nbsp; Bumpkin and Joe were to be in London on the
following day, for it was expected they would be in the
paper.&nbsp; What a flutter of preparation there was at the
farm!&nbsp; Bumpkin was eager, Mrs. Bumpkin anxious.&nbsp; <!--
page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>She had never liked the lawsuit, but had never once
murmured; now she seemed to have a presentiment which she was too
wise to express.&nbsp; And she went about her preparations for
her husband&rsquo;s leaving with all the courage she could
command.&nbsp; It was, however, impossible entirely to repress
her feelings, and now and again as she was packing the flannels
and worsted stockings, a tear would force its way in spite of all
she could do.</p>
<p>Night came, and the fireside was as cosy as ever.&nbsp; But
there was a sense of sadness nevertheless.&nbsp; Tim seemed to
understand that something was not quite as it should be, for he
was restless, and looked up plaintively in his master&rsquo;s
face, and went to Joe and put his head in his lap; then turned
away and stretched himself out on the hearth, winking his eyes at
the fire.</p>
<p>It is always a melancholy effort to &ldquo;keep up the
spirits&rdquo; when the moment of separation is at hand.&nbsp;
One longs for the last shake of the hand and the final
good-bye.&nbsp; This was the case at Southwood Farm on this
memorable evening.&nbsp; Nothing in the room looked as
usual.&nbsp; The pewter plates on the shelf shone indeed, but it
was like the smile of a winter sun; it lacked the usual cheery
warmth.&nbsp; Even the old clock seemed to feel sad as he ticked
out with melancholy monotony the parting moments; and the wind,
as it came in heavy gusts and howled round the old chimney,
seemed more melancholy than need be under the circumstances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thee must be careful, Tom,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bumpkin;
&ldquo;that Lunnun, as I hear, be a terrible plaace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How be un a terrible plaace?&rdquo; said Bumpkin,
sarcastically.&nbsp; &ldquo;I bean&rsquo;t a child,
Nancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thee bean&rsquo;t a child, Tom; but thee
bean&rsquo;t up to <!-- page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>Lunnun ways: there be thieves and
murderers, and what not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thieves and murderers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Joe, doan&rsquo;t ee git out o&rsquo; nights; if
anything &rsquo;appened to thee, thy old mother &rsquo;ud brak
her &rsquo;art.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look ee &rsquo;ere,&rdquo; said Joe, &ldquo;I
bean&rsquo;t got nuthin&rsquo; to lose, so I bean&rsquo;t afeared
o&rsquo; thieves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but thee might git into trouble, thee might be led
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So might thic bull,&rdquo; said Joe; &ldquo;but
I&rsquo;d like to zee what &rsquo;ud become o&rsquo; the chap as
led un.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chap as led un!&rdquo; said Mrs. Bumpkin, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d gie un a crack o&rsquo; the canister,&rdquo;
said Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t thee git knockin&rsquo; down, Joe, unless
thee be &rsquo;bliged,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bumpkin; &ldquo;keep out
o&rsquo; bad company, and don&rsquo;t stay out o&rsquo;
nights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And lookee &rsquo;ere, Joe,&rdquo; said Bumpkin,
&ldquo;when thee comes afore th&rsquo; Counsellor wi&rsquo; wig
on, hold up thee head; look un straight in t&rsquo; face and spak
oop.&nbsp; Thee needn&rsquo;t be afeared t&rsquo; spak t&rsquo;
truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bean&rsquo;t afeard,&rdquo; said Joe; &ldquo;I mind
me when old Morris wur at plough, and I was leadin&rsquo;
th&rsquo; &rsquo;orses, Morris says, says he, &lsquo;Now then,
cock, let&rsquo;s see if we can&rsquo;t git a eend this
time;&rsquo; so on we goes, and jist afore I gits the
&rsquo;orses to eend o&rsquo; t&rsquo; field, Dobbin turns, and
then, dash my bootons, the tother turns after un, and me
tryin&rsquo; to keep em oop, Dobbin gits his legs over the
trace.&nbsp; Well, Morris wur that wild, he says, says he,
&lsquo;Damme, if yer doan&rsquo;t look sharp, I&rsquo;ll gie thee
a crack o&rsquo; t&rsquo; canister wi&rsquo; this &rsquo;ere
whippense presny&rsquo;&rdquo; (presently).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crack o&rsquo; the canister!&rdquo; laughed Mrs.
Bumpkin, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s what Morris called thy head,
eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a capital hit on Joe&rsquo;s part, for it set them
<!-- page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>thinking of the events of old times, and Joe, seeing the
effect of it, ventured upon another anecdote relating to the old
carter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thee recollect, master, when that there Mr. Gearns come
down to shoot; lor, lor, what a queer un he wur,
surely!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t shoot a hit,&rdquo; said Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not he.&nbsp; Wall, we was carrying wheat, and Morris
wur loadin, and jest as we gits the last pitch on t&rsquo; load,
right through th&rsquo; &rsquo;orses legs runds a rat.&nbsp;
Gearns wi&rsquo;out more ado oops wi&rsquo; his loaded gun and
bangs her off right under t&rsquo; &rsquo;orses legs; up jumps
th&rsquo; &rsquo;orse, and Morris wur wery nigh tossed head fust
into th&rsquo; yard.&nbsp; Wall, he makes no moore ado, for he
didn&rsquo;t keer, gemman or no gemman&mdash;didn&rsquo;t
Morris&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more ur didn&rsquo;t, Joe,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He makes no moore ado, but he up and said,
&lsquo;damme,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;sir, you might as well a
said you was gwine to shoot; you might a had me off and broked my
neck.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haw! haw! haw!&rdquo; laughed Mr. Bumpkin, and
&ldquo;Well done, Morris,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wall,&rdquo; said Joe, &ldquo;this ere gemman says,
&lsquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t er bin much loss,&rsquo; he says,
&lsquo;if he had!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Damme,&rsquo; roars Morris,
&lsquo;it had a bin as much wally to me as yourn,
anyhow.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all remembered the story, and even Tim seemed to remember
it too, for when they laughed he wagged his tail and laughed with
them.</p>
<p>And thus the evening dragged along and bed time came.</p>
<p>In the morning all was in readiness, and the plaintiff with
his witness drove away in the gig to the station, where Morris
waited to bring the old horse back.</p>
<p><!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>And as the train came into the little country station I
awoke.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; cried my wife, &ldquo;that Mr. Prigg is
a respectable man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Respectable,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;I know he is;
but whether he is honest is another matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only know what I dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no opinion of him,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;nor
of that Locust; I believe they are a couple of rogues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be very sorry to suggest such a thing as
that,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;without some proof.&nbsp;
Everybody should give credit for the best of motives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what are all these summonses you speak
of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, they are summonses in the action.&nbsp; You may have
as many of them as you can invent occasion for.&nbsp; You may go
up to the Court of Appeal about twenty times before you try the
action, which means about eighty different hearings before Master
and Judges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how can a poor man endure that?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a
great shame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t&mdash;he may have a perfectly good cause
of action against a rich man or a rich company, and they can
utterly ruin him before ever his case can come into
Court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But will no solicitor take it up for the poor
man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, some will, and the only reward they usually get
for their pains is to be stigmatized as having brought a
speculative action&mdash;accused of doing it for the sake of
costs; although I have known the most honourable men do it out of
pure sympathy for the poor man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so they ought,&rdquo; cried she.</p>
<p><!-- page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>&ldquo;And I trust,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that hereafter
it will be considered honourable to do so.&nbsp; It is quite as
honourable, in my judgment, to bring an action when you may never
be paid as to bring it when you know you will be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was the person referred to as &lsquo;the
man?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but I
strongly suspect he is, in reality, a nominee of
Prigg&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is exactly my opinion,&rdquo; said my wife.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And if so, between them, they will ruin that poor
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; said I, lighting my
pipe.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know no more about the future of my dream
than you do; maybe when I sleep again something else will
transpire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But can no one do anything to alter this state of
things?&nbsp; I plainly perceive that they are all against this
poor Bumpkin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, in a tinkering sort of way, a good many
try their hands at reforming the law; but it&rsquo;s to no
one&rsquo;s interest, that I can see, to reform it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll write this dream and publish it, so
that someone&rsquo;s eyes may be opened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may make me enemies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not among honest people; they will all be on your side,
and the dishonest ones, who seem to me to be the only persons
benefited by such a dilatory and shocking mode of procedure, are
the very persons whose enmity you need not fear.&nbsp; But can
the Judges do nothing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; their duty is merely to administer the law, not to
change it.&nbsp; But if the people would only give them full
power and fair play, Old Fogeyism would be buried
to-morrow.&nbsp; They struggle might and main to break through
the fetters, but to no purpose while they are hampered by musty
old precedents, ridiculous forms and bad statutes.&nbsp; They are
not masters of the situation.&nbsp; I <!-- page 95--><a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>wish they
were for the sake of suitors.&nbsp; I would only make one
condition with regard to them.&nbsp; If they were to set about
the task of reform, I would not let the Equity Judges reform the
Common Law nor the Common Law Judges the Equity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought they were fused.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, only transposed.&rdquo;</p>

97</span>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Commencement of London life and
adventures.</p>
<p>And I dreamt again, and methought there were three things with
reference to London that Joe had learnt at school.&nbsp; First,
that there was a Bridge, chiefly remarkable for the fact that
Captain Cook, the Navigator, shot his servant because he said he
was under London Bridge when he was in the South Pacific Ocean;
secondly, that there was a famous Tower, where the Queen&rsquo;s
Crown was kept; thirdly, that there was a Monument built to show
where the Great Fire began, and intimately connected in its cause
with Guy Faux, whom Joe had helped to carry on the Fifth of
November.&nbsp; Now when the young man woke in the morning at
&ldquo;The Goose,&rdquo; in Millbank Street, Westminster, his
attention was immediately attracted by these three historic
objects; and it was not till after he had made inquiries that he
found that it was not London Bridge that crossed the water in a
line with the Horseferry Road, but a very inferior structure
called Lambeth Suspension Bridge.&nbsp; Nor was the Tower on the
left the Tower of London, but the Lollards&rsquo; tower of
Lambeth Palace; while the supposed Monument was only the handsome
column of Messrs. Doulton&rsquo;s Pottery.</p>
<p>But they were all interesting objects nevertheless; and so
were the huge cranes that were at work opposite the <!-- page
98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>house
lifting the most tremendous loads of goods from the lighters to
the wharves.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Shipping,&rdquo; too, with its
black and copper-coloured sails, gave some idea of the extent of
England&rsquo;s mercantile marine.&nbsp; At all events, it
excited the country lad&rsquo;s wonder and astonishment.&nbsp;
But there was another matter that gave quite an agricultural and
countrified look to the busy scene, and that was the prodigious
quantity of straw that was being unloaded from the barges
alongside.&nbsp; While Mr. Bumpkin went to see his solicitor at
Westminster Hall, Joe wandered about the wharves looking at the
boats and barges, the cranes and busy workmen who drove their
barrows from barge to wharf, and ran along with loads on their
backs over narrow planks, in the most lively manner.&nbsp; But
looking on, even at sights like these, day by day, becomes a
wearisome task, and Joe, being by no means an idle lad,
occasionally &ldquo;lent a hand&rdquo; where he saw an
opportunity.&nbsp; London, no doubt, was a very interesting
place, but when he had seen Page Street, and Wood Street, and
Church Street, and Abingdon Street, and Millbank Prison, and the
other interesting objects referred to, his curiosity was
gratified, and he began to grow tired of the sameness of the
place.&nbsp; Occasionally he saw a soldier or two and the
military sight fired his rustic imagination.&nbsp; Not that Joe
had the remotest intention of entering the army; it was the last
thing he would ever dream of; but, in common with all mankind he
liked to look at the smart bearing and brilliant uniform of the
sergeant, who seemed to have little else to do than walk about
with his cane under his arm, or tap the stone parapet with it as
he looked carelessly at some interesting object on the river.</p>
<p><!-- page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>The evenings in the taproom at &ldquo;The Goose&rdquo;
were among the most enjoyable periods of the lad&rsquo;s London
existence.&nbsp; A select party usually gathered there,
consisting chiefly of a young man who never apparently had had
anything to do in his life.&nbsp; His name was Harry Highlow, a
clever sort of wild young scapegrace who played well at
&ldquo;shove-ha&rsquo;penny,&rdquo; and sang a good comic
song.&nbsp; Another of the party was a youth who earned a
precarious livelihood by carrying two boards on his shoulders
advertising a great pickle, or a great singer, as the case might
be.&nbsp; Another of the company was a young man who was either a
discharged or a retired groom; I should presume the former, as he
complained bitterly that the authorities at Scotland Yard would
not grant him a licence to drive a cab.&nbsp; He appeared to be a
striking instance of how every kind of patronage in this country
is distributed by favouritism.&nbsp; There were several others,
all equally candidates for remunerative situations, but equally
unfortunate in obtaining them: proving conclusively that life is
indeed a lottery in which there may be a few prizes, usually
going, by the caprice of Fortune, to the undeserving, while the
blanks went indiscriminately to all the rest.</p>
<p>Bound together by the sympathy which a common misfortune
engenders, these young men were happy in the pursuit of their
innocent amusements at &ldquo;The Goose.&rdquo;&nbsp; And while,
at first, they were a little inclined to chaff the rustic youth
on account of his apparent simplicity, they soon learned to
respect him on account of his exceedingly good temper and his
willingness to fall in with the general views of the company on
all occasions.&nbsp; They learnt all about Joe&rsquo;s business
in London, and it was a common greeting when they met <!-- page
100--><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>in
the evening to ask &ldquo;how the pig was?&rdquo;&nbsp; And they
would enquire what the Lord Chancellor thought about the case,
and whether it wouldn&rsquo;t be as well to grease the
pig&rsquo;s tail and have a pig-hunt.&nbsp; To all which jocular
observations Joe would reply with excellent temper and sometimes
with no inappropriate wit.&nbsp; And then they said they would
like to see Joe tackle Mr. Orkins, and believed he would shut him
up.&nbsp; But chaff never roused his temper, and he laughed at
the case as much as any man there.&nbsp; Fine tales he would have
to tell when he got back to Yokelton; and pleasant, no doubt,
would be in after-life, his recollections of the evenings at
&ldquo;The Goose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a great general surveys the field where the intended action
is to be fought, so Mr. Bumpkin was conducted by Horatio to
Westminster Hall, and shown the various Courts of Justice, and
some of the judges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be this Chancery?&rdquo; he enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O my eye, no!&rdquo; said Horatio; &ldquo;the cause has
been transferred from Chancery to these &rsquo;ere Common Law
Courts.&nbsp; It was only brought in Chancery because the costs
there are upon a higher scale; we didn&rsquo;t mean to try her
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where will she be tried then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In one of these Courts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who be the judge?&rdquo; whispered Bumpkin.</p>
<p>At this moment there was a loud shout of
&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; and although Mr. Bumpkin was making no
noise whatever, a gentleman approached him, looking very angry,
and enquired if Mr. Bumpkin desired to be committed for contempt
of Court.</p>
<p>Mr. Bumpkin thought the most prudent answer was silence; so he
remained speechless, looking the gentleman <!-- page 101--><a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>full in the
face; while the gentleman looked him full in the face for at
least a minute and a half, as if he were wondering whether he
should take him off to prison there and then, or give him another
chance, as the judge sometimes does a prisoner when he sentences
him to two years imprisonment with hard labour.</p>
<p>Now the gentleman was a very amiable man of about forty, with
large brown mutton-chop whiskers, and a very well trained
moustache; good-looking and, I should think, with some humour,
that is for a person connected with the Courts.&nbsp; He was
something about the Court, but in what capacity he held up his
official head, I am unable to say.&nbsp; He was evidently
regarded with great respect by the crowd of visitors.&nbsp; It
was some time before he took his gaze off Mr. Bumpkin; even when
he had taken his eyes off, he seemed looking at him as if he
feared that the moment he went away Bumpkin would do it
again.</p>
<p>And then methought I heard someone whisper near me: &ldquo;His
lordship is going to give judgment in the case of <i>Starling</i>
v. <i>Nightingale</i>,&rdquo; and all at once there was a great
peace.&nbsp; I lost sight of Bumpkin, I lost sight of the
gentleman, I lost sight of the crowd; an indefinable sensation of
delight overpowered my senses.&nbsp; Where was I?&nbsp; I had but
a moment before been in a Court of Justice, with crowds of gaping
idlers; with prosaic-looking gentlemen in horsehair wigs; with
gentlemen in a pew with papers before them ready to take down the
proceedings.&nbsp; Now it seemed as if I must be far away in the
distant country, where all was calm and heavenly peace.</p>
<p>Surely I must be among the water-lilies!&nbsp; What a lullaby
sound as of rippling waters and of distant music <!-- page
102--><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>in
the evening air; of the eddying and swirl of the mingling
currents; of the chime of bells on the evening breeze; of the
zephyrs through fir-tops; of woodland whispers; of the cadence of
the cathedral organ; of the soft sweet melody of the
maiden&rsquo;s laugh; of her gentlest accents in her sweetest
mood; of&mdash;but similitudes fail me.&nbsp; In this delicious
retreat, which may be compared to the Garden of Eden before the
tempter entered, are the choicest flowers of rhetoric.&nbsp; I
hear a voice as from the far-off past, and I wonder will that be
the voice which will utter the &ldquo;last syllable of recorded
time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then methought the scene changed, and I heard the
question&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you move, Mr. Jones?&rdquo;</p>
<p>O the prosaic Jones!&mdash;&ldquo;don&rsquo;t you
move?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, he does; he partly rises, ducks his head, and elevates
the hinder portion of his person, and his movement ceases.&nbsp;
And the question is repeated to Mr. Quick.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you
move, Mr. Quick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I saw Mr. Bumpkin again, just as Mr. Quick ducked his
head and elevated his back.</p>
<p>And then some gentleman actually moved in real earnest upon
these interesting facts:&mdash;A farmer&rsquo;s bull&mdash;just
the very case for Mr. Bumpkin&mdash;had strayed from the road and
gone into another man&rsquo;s yard, and upset a tub of meal; was
then driven into a shed and locked up.&nbsp; The owner of the
bull came up and demanded that the animal should be
released.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not without paying two pounds,&rdquo; said
the meal-owner.&nbsp; The bull owner paid it under protest, and
summoned the meal-owner to the County Court for one pound
seventeen shillings and sixpence, the difference between the
damage done (which was really about twopence) and the money paid
to redeem <!-- page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 103</span>the bull.&nbsp; Judgment for the
plaintiff.&nbsp; Motion for new trial, or to enter verdict for
the defendant, on the ground that the meal man could charge what
he liked.</p>
<p>One of the learned Judges asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to tell me, Mr. Smiles, that if a man has a
bull, and that bull goes into a yard and eats some meal out of a
meal-tub, and the damage amounts to twopence, and the owner of
the bull says &lsquo;here&rsquo;s your twopence,&rsquo; that the
owner of the meal can say, &ldquo;No, I want a hundred pounds,
and shall take your bull damage feasant,&rdquo; and then takes
him and locks him up, and the owner of the bull pays the hundred
pounds, he cannot afterwards get the money back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is so,&rdquo; says the learned counsel,
&ldquo;such is the law.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then he cited cases
innumerable to prove that it was the law.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Judge, &ldquo;unless you show me
a case of a bull and a meal-tub, I shall not pay attention to any
case&mdash;must be a meal-tub.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Second Judge: &ldquo;It is extortion, and done for the purpose
of extortion; and I should say he could be indicted for obtaining
money by false pretences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not sure he could not, my lord,&rdquo; said the
counsel; &ldquo;but he can&rsquo;t recover the money
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the Judge, &ldquo;if he obtains money
by an indictable fraud cannot he get it back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bumpkin, &ldquo;that be rum law; if
it had bin my bull, he&rsquo;d a gin &rsquo;em summat afore they
runned him in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was interesting to see how the judges struggled against
this ridiculous law; and it was manifest even to the unlettered
Bumpkin, that a good deal of old law is very much like old
clothes, the worse for wear, and <!-- page 104--><a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>totally
inapplicable to the present day.&nbsp; A struggle against old
authorities is often a struggle of Judges to free themselves from
the fetters of antiquated dicta and decisions no longer
appropriate to or necessary for the modern requirements of
civilisation.</p>
<p>In this case precedents running over <i>one hundred and eight
years</i> were quoted, and so far from impressing the Court with
respect, they simply evoked a smile of contempt.</p>
<p>The learned Judges, after patiently listening to the
arguments, decided that extortion and fraud give no title, and
thus were the mists and vapours that arose from the accumulated
mudbanks of centuries dispelled by the clear shining of common
sense.&nbsp; In spite of arguments by the hour, and the
pettifogging of one hundred and eight years, justice prevailed,
and the amazed appellant was far more damaged by his legal
proceedings than he was by the bull.&nbsp; The moral surely is,
that however wise ancient judges were in their day, their wisdom
ought not to be allowed to work injustice.&nbsp; He may be a wise
Judge who makes a precedent, but he is often a much wiser who
sweeps it away.</p>
<h2><!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span

<p class="gutsumm">How the great Don O&rsquo;Rapley became an
usher of the Court of Queen&rsquo;s Bench and explained the
ingenious invention of the round square&mdash;how Mr. Bumpkin
took the water and studied character from a penny steamboat.</p>
<p>Some years ago there lived in a little village near
Bridgewater a young man who was the bowler of his village
eleven&mdash;one of the first roundhand bowlers in point of time,
and by no means the last in point of merit.&nbsp; Indeed, so
great was the local fame of this young man that it produced a
sensation for miles around when it was announced that Don
O&rsquo;Rapley (such was his name) was going to bowl.&nbsp; All
the boys of the village where the match was to take place were in
a state of the utmost excitement to see the Don.&nbsp; At times
it was even suggested that he was unfairly &ldquo;smugged
in&rdquo; to play for a village to which he had no pretensions to
belong.&nbsp; In process of time the youth became a man, and by
virtue of his cricket reputation he obtained a post in the Court
of Queen&rsquo;s Bench.&nbsp; The gentleman whom I have referred
to as looking with such austerity at Mr. Bumpkin is that very Don
O&rsquo;Rapley; the requirements of a large family necessitated
his abandonment of a profession which, although more to his
taste, was not sufficiently remunerative to admit of his
indulging it <!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>after the birth of his sixth
child.&nbsp; But it was certain that he never lost his love for
the relinquished pursuit, as was manifest from his habit when
alone of frequently going through a kind of dumb motion with his
arm as if he were delivering one of his celebrated
&ldquo;twisters.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had even been seen in a quiet
corner of the Court to go through the same performance in a
somewhat modified form.&nbsp; He was once caught by the Judge in
the very act of delivering a ball, but found a ready apology in
the explanation that he had a touch of &ldquo;rheumatiz&rdquo; in
his right shoulder.</p>
<p>Now I saw in my dream that Don O&rsquo;Rapley was in earnest
conversation with Horatio, and it was clear Mr. Bumpkin was the
subject of it, from the very marked manner in which the Don and
the youth turned occasionally to look at him.&nbsp; It may be
stated that Horatio was the nephew of Don O&rsquo;Rapley, and,
perhaps, it was partly in consequence of this relationship, and
partly in consequence of what Horatio told him, that the latter
gentleman rose from his seat under the witness-box and came
towards Mr. Bumpkin, shouting as he did so in a very solemn and
prolonged tone, &ldquo;Si-lence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bumpkin saw him, and, conscious that he was innocent this
time of any offence for which he could be committed, stood his
ground with a bold front, and firmly held his white beaver with
both hands.&nbsp; O&rsquo;Rapley contemplated him for a few
minutes with an almost affectionate interest.&nbsp; Bumpkin felt
much as a pigeon would under the gaze of an admiring owl.</p>
<p>At last O&rsquo;Rapley spoke:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s never Mr. Bumpkin, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It be a good imitation, sir,&rdquo; said Bumpkin,
&ldquo;and I bean&rsquo;t asheamed of un.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 107--><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; cried the Don.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t remember me, I s&rsquo;pose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wall, not rightly, I doan&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dissay you recollect Don O&rsquo;Rapley, the demon
bowler of Bridgewater?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve &rsquo;eered tell on &rsquo;im,&rdquo; said
Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m that man!&rdquo; said the Don, &ldquo;and
this is my nephew, Mr. Snigger.&nbsp; He tells me you&rsquo;ve
got a case comin&rsquo; on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just step outside,&rdquo; said the Don, &ldquo;we
mustn&rsquo;t talk &rsquo;ere.&rdquo;&nbsp; So they went into
Westminster Hall, and the good-natured O&rsquo;Rapley asked if
Mr. Bumpkin would like to look round, and if so he said he would
be happy to show him, for he was very pleased to see anyone from
the scene of his youthful exploits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thankee, sir&mdash;thankee, sir,&rdquo; answered
Bumpkin, delighted to find another &ldquo;native&rdquo; among
&ldquo;furriners.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And this &rsquo;ere
genleman be thy nevvy, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is, and very proud of him I am; he&rsquo;s my
sister&rsquo;s son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems a nice quiet boy,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumpkin.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Now how old might he be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old,&rdquo; said Mr. O&rsquo;Rapley, looking deedily at
the floor and pressing his hand to his forehead, &ldquo;why
he&rsquo;ll be seventeen come March.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hem! his &rsquo;ed be a good deal older nor thic: his
&rsquo;ed be forty&mdash;it&rsquo;s my way o&rsquo;
thinkin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Don laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he has his head screwed on the right way, I
think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why that air lad,&rdquo; said Bumpkin, &ldquo;might
make a judge.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>O&rsquo;Rapley laughed and shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In old times,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;he might ha&rsquo;
made a Lord Chancellor; a man as was clever had a chance then,
but lor&rsquo; blesh you, Mr. Bumpkin, now-a-days it&rsquo;s so
very different; the raw material is that plentiful in the law
that you can find fifty men as would make rattlin good Lord
Chancellors for one as you could pick out to make a
rattlin&rsquo; good bowler.&nbsp; But come, we&rsquo;ll have a
look round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So round they looked again, and Mr. Bumpkin was duly impressed
with the array of wigs and the number of books and the solemnity
of the judges and the arguments of counsel, not one word of which
was intelligible to him.&nbsp; Mr. O&rsquo;Rapley explained
everything and pointed out where a judge and jury tried a case,
and then took him into another court where two judges tried the
judge and jury, and very often set them both aside and gave new
trials and altered verdicts and judgments or refused to do so
notwithstanding the elaborate arguments of the most eloquent and
long-winded of learned counsel.</p>
<p>Then the Don asked if Mr. Bumpkin would like to see the
Chancery Judges&mdash;to which Mr. Bumpkin answered that
&ldquo;he hadn&rsquo;t much opinion o&rsquo; Chancery from all
he&rsquo;d &rsquo;eeard, and that when a man got into them there
Cooarts maybe he&rsquo;d never coome out agin, but he
shouldn&rsquo;t mind seein&rsquo; a Chancery Judge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said the distinguished bowler,
&ldquo;now-a-days we needn&rsquo;t go to Chancery, for
they&rsquo;ve invented the &lsquo;Round Square.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bumpkin stared.&nbsp; Could so great a man as the
O&rsquo;Rapley be joking?&nbsp; No; the Don seldom laughed.&nbsp;
He was a great admirer of everything relating to the law, but had
a marked prejudice against the new system; <!-- page 109--><a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>and when he
spoke of the &ldquo;Round Square&rdquo; he meant, as he
afterwards explained, that confusion of Law and Equity which
consists in putting Chancery Judges to try common law cases and
Common Law Judges to unravel the nice twistings of the elaborate
system of Equity; &ldquo;as though,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you
should fuse the butcher and the baker by getting the former to
make bread and the latter to dress a calf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bumpkin could only stare by way of reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want to see Chancery Judges,&rdquo; added the
Don, &ldquo;come to the Old Bailey!&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 111</span>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">An interesting gentleman&mdash;showing how
true it is that one half the world does not know how the other
half lives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Old Bailey,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumpkin, as they
crossed Palace Yard on their way to the steamboat pier,
&ldquo;bean&rsquo;t that where all these &rsquo;ere chaps be
tried for ship stealin&rsquo;?&rdquo; (sheep stealing).</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about ship stealing,&rdquo; said
O&rsquo;Rapley, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s a place where they can cure
all sorts of diseases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zounds!&rdquo; exclaimed Bumpkin, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
&rsquo;eeard tell of un.&nbsp; A horsepital you
means&mdash;dooan&rsquo;t want to goo there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horse or donkey, it don&rsquo;t matter what,&rdquo;
said Don O&rsquo;Rapley.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got a stuff
that&rsquo;s so strong a single drop will cure any disease
you&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if it &rsquo;ud cure my old
&rsquo;ooman&rsquo;s roomatiz.&nbsp; It &rsquo;ud be wuth
tryin&rsquo;, maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll warrant it,&rdquo; replied the Don.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She&rsquo;d never feel &rsquo;em after takin&rsquo; one
drop,&rdquo; and he drew his hand across his mouth and
coughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to try un,&rdquo; said the farmer,
&ldquo;for she be a terrible suffrer in these &rsquo;ere east
winds.&nbsp; &rsquo;As &rsquo;em like all up the
grine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the Don, &ldquo;it don&rsquo;t matter
where she &rsquo;as &rsquo;em, it will cure her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do &rsquo;em sell it&mdash;in bottles?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t in bottles&mdash;you take it
by the foot; about nine feet&rsquo;s considered a goodish
dose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bumpkin looked straight before him, somewhat puzzled at
this extraordinary description of a medicine.&nbsp; At length he
got a glimmering of the Don&rsquo;s meaning, and, looking
towards, but not quite at him, said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I be up to &rsquo;ee, sir!&rdquo; and the Don laughed,
and asked whether his description wasn&rsquo;t right?</p>
<p>&ldquo;That be right enough.&nbsp; Zounds! it be right
enough.&nbsp; Haw! haw! haw!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never want a second dose,&rdquo; said the Don,
&ldquo;do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir&mdash;never wants moore &rsquo;an one dose; but
&rsquo;ow comes it, if you please, sir, that these &rsquo;ere
Chancery chaps have changed their tack; be it they&rsquo;ve tried
&rsquo;onest men so long that they be gwine to &rsquo;ave a slap
at the thieves for a change?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look &rsquo;ere,&rdquo; said the worthy O&rsquo;Rapley,
&ldquo;you will certainly see the inside of a jail before you set
eyes on the outside of a haystack, if you go on like that.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s contempt of court to speak of Her Majesty&rsquo;s
Judges as &lsquo;chaps&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beg pardon, sir,&rdquo; said Bumpkin, &ldquo;but we
must all &rsquo;ave a larnin&rsquo;.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t mane no
disruspect to the Lord Judge; but I wur only a axin&rsquo; jist
the same as you might ax me about anythink on my farm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I saw that they proceeded thus in edifying conversation
until they came to the Thames embankment.&nbsp; It was somewhat
difficult to preserve his presence of mind as Mr. Bumpkin
descended the gangway and stepped on board the boat, which was
belching forth its volumes of black smoke and rocking under the
influence of the wash of a steamer that had just left the
pier.</p>
<p><!-- page 113--><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>&ldquo;I doant much like these &rsquo;ere
booats,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Doant mind my old punt, but
dang these &rsquo;ere ships.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no danger,&rdquo; said the
O&rsquo;Rapley, springing on board as though he had been a pilot:
and then making a motion with his arm as if he was delivering a
regular &ldquo;length ball,&rdquo; his fist unfortunately came
down on Mr. Bumpkin&rsquo;s white hat, in consequence of a sudden
jerk of the vessel; a rocking boat not being the best of places
for the delivery of length balls.</p>
<p>Mr. Bumpkin looked round quite in the wrong direction for
ascertaining what was the cause of the sudden shock to his
nervous system and his hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zounds!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what were
thic?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was what?&rdquo; asked O&rsquo;Rapley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Summut gie me a crack o&rsquo; the top o&rsquo; my
&rsquo;ead like a thunderbolt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see anything fall,&rdquo; said the
Don.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noa; but I felt un, which I allows wur more&rsquo;n
seein&rsquo;&mdash;lookee &rsquo;ere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And taking off his huge beaver he showed the dent of Mr.
O&rsquo;Rapley&rsquo;s fist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless me,&rdquo; said the roundhand bowler,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s like a crack with a cricket ball.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But there was no time for further examination of the
extraordinary circumstance, for the crowd of passengers poured
along and pushed this way and that, so that the two friends were
fairly driven to the fore part of the boat, where they took their
seats.&nbsp; It was quite a new world to Mr. Bumpkin, and more
like a dream than a reality.&nbsp; As he stared at the different
buildings he was too much amazed even to enquire what was this or
what was that.&nbsp; But when they passed under the Suspension
Bridge, and the chimney ducked her head and the smoke <!-- page
114--><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>came out of the &ldquo;stump,&rdquo; as Mr. Bumpkin
termed it, he thought she had struck and broken short off.&nbsp;
Mr. O&rsquo;Rapley explained this phenomenon, as he did many
others on their route; and when they came to Cleopatra&rsquo;s
Needle he gave such information as he possessed concerning that
ancient work.&nbsp; Mr. Bumpkin looked as though he were not to
be taken in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I be up to &rsquo;ee, sir,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose that air thing the t&rsquo;other side were
the needle-case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The O&rsquo;Rapley informed him that it was a shot tower where
they made shot.</p>
<p>Mr. Bumpkin laughed heartily at this; he was not to be taken
in by any manner of means; was far too sharp for that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I spoase,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;they makes the
guns&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Gunnersbury,&rdquo; said Mr. O&rsquo;Rapley; it was
no use to be serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought thee were gwine to say in a gun pit, but I
don&rsquo;t mind thy chaff, Master Rapley, and shall be mighty
proud to see thee down at Southood for a day&rsquo;s
shoot-in&rsquo;: and mind thee bring some o&rsquo; these ere shot
with thee that be made at yon tower, haw! haw! haw!&nbsp;
Thee&rsquo;ll kill a white-tailed crow then, I shouldn&rsquo;t
wonder; thee knows a white-tailed crow, doan&rsquo;t thee, Master
Rapley, when thee sees un&mdash;and danged if I doan&rsquo;t gie
thee a quart bottle o&rsquo; pigeon&rsquo;s milk to tak&rsquo;
wi&rsquo; thee; haw! haw! haw!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The O&rsquo;Rapley laughed heartily at these witty sallies,
for Bumpkin was so jolly, and took everything in such good part,
that he could not but enjoy his somewhat misplaced sarcasms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ve heard of Waterloo, I dare say,&rdquo;
said Mr. O&rsquo;Rapley.</p>
<p><!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve &rsquo;eeard tell on un, and
furder, my grand-feather wur out theer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this that we are coming to is Waterloo
Bridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bumpkin, &ldquo;it be a bridge, but it
bean&rsquo;t Worterloo more &rsquo;an I be my
grandfearther&mdash;what de think o&rsquo; that&mdash;haw! haw!
haw!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Rapley; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
quite right, but this is the bridge named after the
battle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zo&rsquo;t be neamed artur un because it worn&rsquo;t
named afore un, haw! haw! haw!&nbsp; Good agin, Maister Rapley,
thee got it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. O&rsquo;Rapley found that any attempt to convey
instruction was useless, so he said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joking apart, Mr. Bumpkin, you see that man sitting
over there with the wideawake hat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;ye mane near the noase o&rsquo; the
ship?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the nose if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I zee un&mdash;chap wi&rsquo; red faace, blue
&rsquo;ankercher, and white spots?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the man.&nbsp; Well, now, you&rsquo;d
never guess who he is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bumpkin certainly would have been a sharp man if he
could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued the Don, &ldquo;that man gets
his living by bringing actions.&nbsp; No matter who it is or
what, out comes the writ and down he comes for
damages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hem! that be rum, too, bean&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s always looking out for accidents; if he
hears o&rsquo; one, down he comes with his pocket-book, gets
&rsquo;old o&rsquo; some chap that&rsquo;s injured, or thinks he
is, and out comes the writ.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>&ldquo;What be he then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A scamp&mdash;works in the name of some broken-down
attorney, and pays him for the use of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he can work the lor like wirout being a
loryer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it&mdash;and, lor&rsquo; bless you,
he&rsquo;s got such a way with him that if he was to come and
talk to you for five minutes, he&rsquo;d have a writ out against
you in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it rayther cold at this eend o&rsquo; the
booat,&rdquo; asked Mr. Bumpkin, &ldquo;I feel a little chilly
loike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Don, &ldquo;we just caught the wind
at that corner, that was all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Mr. Bumpkin kept his eye on the artful man, with a full
determination to &ldquo;have no truck wi&rsquo; un.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I was saying, this Ananias never misses a chance:
he&rsquo;s on the look-out at this moment; if they was to push
that gangway against his toe, down he&rsquo;d go and be laid up
with an injured spine and concussion of the brain, till he got
damages from the company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be a reg&rsquo;ler rogue, I allows; I should like
to push un overboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what he would like; he isn&rsquo;t born to be
drowned, that man; he&rsquo;d soon have a writ out against
you.&nbsp; There was a railway accident once miles away in the
country; ever so many people were injured and some of &rsquo;em
killed.&nbsp; Well, down he goes to see if he could get hold of
anybody&mdash;no, nobody would have him&mdash;so what does he do
but bring an action himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, just the same as if he&rsquo;d been in the
accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ought to be hanged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the doctors were very pleased to find that no
bones were broken, and, although there were no bruises, <!-- page
117--><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>they discovered that there were internal injuries: the
spine was wrong, and there was concussion of the brain, and so
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If ever I &rsquo;eerd tell o&rsquo; sich a thing in my
borned days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but it&rsquo;s true.&nbsp; Well, he was laid up a
long time under medical treatment, and it was months before he
could get about, and then he brings his action: but before it
came on he prosecutes his servant for stealing some trumpery
thing or other&mdash;a very pretty girl she was too&mdash;and the
trial came on at Quarter Sessions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where Squoire Stooky sits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never laughed so in all my life; there was the
railway company with the red light, and there was Fireaway, the
counsel for the girl, and then in hobbled the prosecutor, with a
great white bandage round his head.&nbsp; He was so feeble
through the injuries he had received that he could hardly
walk.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now then,&rsquo; says the counsel, &lsquo;is
he sworn?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; says the crier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He must be sworn on the Koran,&rsquo; says
Fireaway; &lsquo;he&rsquo;s a Mommadon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Where&rsquo;s the Jorum?&rsquo; says the
crier.&nbsp; &lsquo;Must be swore on the Jorum.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O dear, dear, you should ha&rsquo; heard &rsquo;em
laugh&mdash;it was more like a theayter than a court.&nbsp; It
was not only roars, but continnerus roars for several
minutes.&nbsp; And all the time the larfter was going on there
was this man throwin&rsquo; out his arms over the witness-box at
the counsel like a madman; and the more he raved the more they
laughed.&nbsp; He was changed from a hobblin&rsquo; invalid, as
the counsel said, into a hathletic pugilist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I &rsquo;ope she got off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got off with flying colours&mdash;we&rsquo;re
magnanimous said the jury, &lsquo;not guilty.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 118--><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>&ldquo;Well, I likes upright and down-straight,&rdquo;
said Bumpkin, &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll goo furdest in th&rsquo; long
run.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Rapley, &ldquo;and the longer
the run the furder it&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So &rsquo;t wool; but if you doan&rsquo;t mind, sir,
I&rsquo;d like to get nearer that &rsquo;ere
fireplace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The funnel&mdash;very well.&rdquo;&nbsp; And as they
moved Mr. O&rsquo;Rapley, in the exuberance of his spirits,
delivered another ball at the chimney, which apparently took the
middle stump, for the chimney again broke in half.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got him!&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I quite agree,
and I&rsquo;ll tell you for why.&nbsp; You can play a straight
ball if you mind what you are about&mdash;just take your bat so,
and bring your left elbow well round so, and keep your bat, as
you say, upright and down-straight, so&mdash;and there you
are.&nbsp; And there, indeed, Mr. Bumpkin was, on his back, for
the boat at that moment bumped so violently against the side of
the pier that many persons were staggering about as if they were
in a storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zounds!&rdquo; said the farmer, as he was being picked
up&mdash;&ldquo;these &rsquo;ere booats, I doan&rsquo;t like
&rsquo;em&mdash;gie me the ole-fashioned uns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now came the usual hullabaloo, &ldquo;Stand back!&mdash;pass
on!&mdash;out of the way! now, then, look sharp there!&rdquo; and
the pushing of the gangway against people&rsquo;s shins as though
they were so many skittles to be knocked over, and then came the
slow process of &ldquo;passing out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing,&rdquo; whispered
O&rsquo;Rapley, &ldquo;if you do break your leg the
company&rsquo;s liable&mdash;that&rsquo;s one comfort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thankee, sir,&rdquo; answered Bumpkin, &ldquo;but I
bean&rsquo;t a gwine to break my leg for the sake o&rsquo; a
haction&mdash;and mebbee ha&rsquo; to pay the costs.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span

<p class="gutsumm">THE OLD BAILEY&mdash;ADVANTAGES OF THE NEW
SYSTEM ILLUSTRATED.</p>
<p>And I saw in my dream that Don O&rsquo;Rapley and worthy
Master Bumpkin proceeded together until they came to the Old
Bailey; that delightful place which will ever impress me with the
belief that the Satanic Personage is not a homeless
wanderer.&nbsp; As they journeyed together O&rsquo;Rapley asked
whether there was any particular kind of case which he would
prefer&mdash;much the same as he would enquire what he would like
for lunch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, thankee, sir,&rdquo; said Bumpkin, &ldquo;what he
there?&rdquo;&mdash;just the same as a hungry guest would ask the
waiter for the bill of fare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. O&rsquo;Rapley,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s no murder to-day, but there&rsquo;s sure to
be highway robberies, burglaries, rapes, and so on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wall, I thinks one o&rsquo; them air as good as
anything,&rdquo; said Bumpkin.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wur on the jury
once when a chap were tried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he get off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got off as clane as a whusle.&nbsp; Not guilty, we all
said: sarved her right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather early in the morning,
p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps,&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Rapley; &ldquo;but
there&rsquo;s sure to be something interesting <!-- page 120--><a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>before
lunch&mdash;crimes are very pop&rsquo;lar, and for my own part, I
think they&rsquo;re as nice as anything: divorces,
p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps, are as good, and the female intellect
prefers &rsquo;em as a more digestable food for their
minds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a what, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, since they did away with <i>crim. cons</i>,
there&rsquo;s nothing left for females but murders and divorces,
worth speaking of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, how&rsquo;s that, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, they&rsquo;re not considered sufficiently moral,
that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; You see, Master Bumpkin, we&rsquo;re
getting to be a very moral and good people.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re
doin&rsquo; away with all that&rsquo;s naughty, such as music and
dancing, peep-shows and country fairs.&nbsp; This is a religious
age.&nbsp; No pictur galleries on a Sunday, but as many
public-houses as you like; it&rsquo;s wicked to look at picturs
on a Sunday.&nbsp; And now I&rsquo;ll tell you another thing,
Master Bumpkin, although p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps I ought to keep my
mouth closed; but &rsquo;ere you&rsquo;ll see a Chancery Judge as
knows everything about land and titles to property, and all that,
and never had any training in Criminal Courts, and may be never
been inside of one before, you&rsquo;ll see &rsquo;im down
&rsquo;ere tryin&rsquo; burglaries and robberies, and down at the
Assizes you&rsquo;ll see &rsquo;im tryin&rsquo; men and women for
stealing mutton pies and a couple of ounces of bacon;
that&rsquo;s the way the Round Square&rsquo;s worked, Master
Bumpkin; and very well it acts.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a moral
atmosphere, too, about the Courts which is very curious.&nbsp; It
seems to make every crime look bigger than it really is.&nbsp;
But as I say, where&rsquo;s the human natur of a Chancery
barrister?&nbsp; How can you get it in Chancery?&nbsp; They only
sees human natur in a haffidavit, and although I don&rsquo;t say
you can&rsquo;t <!-- page 121--><a name="page121"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 121</span>put a lot of it into a haffidavit,
such as perjury and such like, yet it&rsquo;s so done up by the
skill of the profession that you can hardly see it.&nbsp;
Learning from haffidavits isn&rsquo;t like learning from the
witness-box, mark my words, Mr. Bumpkin; and so you&rsquo;ll find
when you come to hear a case or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having thus eloquently delivered himself, Mr. O&rsquo;Rapley
paused to see its effect: but there was no answer.&nbsp; There
was no doubt the Don could talk a-bit, and took especial pride in
expressing his views on law reform, which, to his idea, would
best be effected by returning to the &ldquo;old style.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I saw that they pushed their way through a crowd of people
of all sorts and degrees of unwashedness and crime, and proceeded
up a winding stair, through other crowds of the most evil-looking
indictable persons you could meet with out of the Bottomless
Pit.</p>
<p>And amongst them were pushing, with eager, hungry, dirty
faces, men who called themselves clerks, evil-disposed persons
who traded under such names as their owners could use no longer
on their own account.&nbsp; These prowlers amongst thieves, under
the protection of the Law, were permitted to extort what they
could from the friends of miserable prisoners under pretence of
engaging counsel to defend them.&nbsp; Counsel they would engage
after a fashion&mdash;sometimes: but not unfrequently they
cheated counsel, client and the law at the same time, which is
rather better than killing two birds with one stone.</p>
<p>And the two friends, after threading their way through the
obnoxious crowd, came to the principal Court of the Old Bailey,
called the &ldquo;Old Court,&rdquo; and a very evil-looking <!--
page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>place it was.&nbsp; All the ghosts of past criminals
seemed floating in the dingy atmosphere.&nbsp; Crowds of men,
women and children were heaped together in all directions, except
on the bench and in a kind of pew which was reserved for such
ladies as desired to witness the last degradation of human
nature.</p>
<p>Presently came in, announced with a loud cry of
&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Be uncovered in Court!&rdquo; a
gorgeous array of stout and berobed gentlemen, with massive
chains and purple faces.&nbsp; These, I learned, were the noble
Aldermen of the Corporation.&nbsp; What a contrast to the meagre
wretches who composed the crowd!&nbsp; Here was a picture of what
well-fed honesty and virtue could accomplish for human nature on
the one part, as opposed to what hungry crime could effect, on
the other.&nbsp; Blessings, say I, on good victuals!&nbsp; It is
a great promoter of innocence.&nbsp; And I thought how many of
the poor, half-starved, cadaverous wretches who crowded into the
dock in all their emaciated wretchedness and rags would, under
other conditions, have become as portly and rubicund and as moral
as the row of worthy aldermen who sat looking at them with
contempt from their exalted position.</p>
<p>The rich man doesn&rsquo;t steal a loaf of bread; he has no
temptation to do so: the uneducated thief doesn&rsquo;t get up
sham companies, because <i>he</i> has no temptation to do
so.&nbsp; Temptation and Opportunity have much to answer for in
the destinies of men.&nbsp; Honesty is the best policy, but it is
not always the most expedient or practicable.</p>
<p>Now there was much arraignment of prisoners, and much swearing
of jurymen, and proclamations about &ldquo;informing my Lords
Justices and the Queen&rsquo;s Attorney-General of any crimes,
misdemeanours, felonies, &amp;c., committed <!-- page 123--><a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>by any of
the prisoners,&rdquo; and &ldquo;if anybody could so inform my
Lords Justices,&rdquo; &amp;c, he was to come forward and do so,
and he would be heard.&nbsp; And then the crowd of prisoners,
except the one about to be tried, were told to stand down.&nbsp;
And down they all swarmed, some laughing and some crying, to the
depths below.&nbsp; And the stout warders took their stand beside
the remaining prisoner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Mr. O&rsquo;Rapley, &ldquo;this Judge
is quite fresh to the work, and I&rsquo;ll warrant he&rsquo;ll
take a moral view of the law, which is about the worst view a
Judge <i>can</i> take.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man left in the dock was a singular specimen of humanity:
he was a thin, wizen-looking man of about seventy, with a wooden
leg: and as he stood up to plead, leant on two crutches, while
his head shook a good deal, as if he had got the palsy.&nbsp; A
smile went round the bar, and in some places broke out into a
laugh: the situation was, indeed, ridiculous; and before any but
a Chancery Judge, methought, there must be an acquittal on the
view.&nbsp; However, I saw that the man pleaded not guilty, and
then Mr. Makebelieve opened the case for the Crown.&nbsp; He put
it very clearly, and, as he said, fairly before the jury; and
then called a tall, large-boned woman of about forty into the
witness-box.&nbsp; This was the &ldquo;afflicted widow,&rdquo; as
Makebelieve had called her; and the way she gave her evidence
made a visible impression on the mind of the learned Judge.&nbsp;
His Lordship looked up occasionally from his note-book and fixed
his eyes on the prisoner, whose appearance was that of one
trembling with a consciousness of guilt&mdash;that is, to one not
versed in human nature outside an affidavit.</p>
<p><!-- page 124--><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>Mr. Nimble, the prisoner&rsquo;s counsel, asked if the
prisoner might sit down as he was very &ldquo;infirm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you an affidavit of that fact, Mr. Nimble?&rdquo;
asked the Judge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my lord; it is not usual on such an application to
have an affidavit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not usual,&rdquo; said his lordship, &ldquo;to
take notice of any fact not upon affidavit; but in this case the
prisoner may sit down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prosecutrix gave her evidence very flippantly, and did not
seem in the least concerned that her virtue had had so narrow an
escape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; asked Mr. Nimble, &ldquo;what are
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The learned Judge said he could not see what that had to do
with the question.&nbsp; Could Mr. Nimble resist the facts?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my lord,&rdquo; answered the learned counsel;
&ldquo;and I intend, in the first place, to resist them by
showing that this woman is entirely unworthy of
credit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you really going to suggest perjury, Mr.
Nimble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Assuredly, my lord!&nbsp; I am going to show that there
is not a word of truth in this woman&rsquo;s statement.&nbsp; I
have a right to cross-examine as to her credit.&nbsp; If your
lordship will allow me, I will&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cross-examination, Mr. Nimble, cannot be allowed, in
order to make a witness contradict all that she has said in her
examination-in-chief; it would be a strange state of the law, if
it could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Nimble looked about the desk, and then under it, and felt
in his bag, and at last exclaimed in a somewhat petulant
tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my Taylor?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>&ldquo;What do you want your tailor for?&rdquo; asked
the Judge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to point out to your lordship that my
proposition is correct, and that I can cross-examine to the
credit of a witness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the clerk of arraigns, who sat just under the learned
Judge, and was always consulted on matters of practice when there
was any difficulty, was seen whispering to his lordship: after
which his lordship looked very blank and red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We always consult him, my lord,&rdquo; said Mr. Nimble,
with a smile, &ldquo;in suits at Common Law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everybody tried not to laugh, and everybody failed.&nbsp; Even
the Judge, being a very good-tempered man, laughed too, and
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;O yes, Taylor on Evidence, Mr. Nimble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last the book, about the size of a London Directory, was
handed up by a tall man who was Mr. Nimble&rsquo;s clerk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, my lord, at page nineteen hundred and seventy-two
your lordship will find that when the credibility of a witness is
attacked&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judge: &ldquo;That will be near the end of the
book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Nimble: &ldquo;No, my lord, near the beginning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not stop you,&rdquo; said the learned Judge;
&ldquo;your question may be put for what it is worth: but now,
suppose in answer to your question she says she is an ironer,
what then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I am, my lordship,&rdquo; said the
woman, with an obsequious curtsey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, now you have it,&rdquo; said the Judge,
&ldquo;she is an ironer; stop, let me take that down, &lsquo;I am
an ironer.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cross-examination continued, somewhat in an <!-- page
126--><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>angry tone no doubt, and amid frequent interruptions;
but Mr. Nimble always thumped down the ponderous Taylor upon any
objection of the learned Judge, and crushed it as though it were
a butterfly.</p>
<p>Next the policeman gave his evidence, and was duly
cross-examined.&nbsp; Mr. Nimble called no witnesses; there were
none to call: but addressed the jury in a forcible and eloquent
speech, stigmatizing the charge as an utterly preposterous one,
and dealing with every fact in a straightforward and manly
manner.&nbsp; After he had finished, the jury would undoubtedly
have acquitted; but the learned Judge had to sum up, which in
this, as in many cases at Quarter Sessions, was no more a summing
up than counting ten on your fingers is a summing up.&nbsp; It
was a desultory speech, and if made by the counsel for the
prosecution, would have been a most unfair one for the Crown:
totally ignoring the fact that human nature was subject to
frailties, and testimony liable to be tainted with perjury.&nbsp;
It made so great an impression upon me in my dream that I
transcribed it when I awoke; and this is the manner in which it
dealt with the main points:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Gentlemen of the Jury</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a case of a very serious character (the nature
of the offence was then read from Roscoe), and I am bound to tell
you that the evidence is all one way: namely, on the side of the
prosecution.&nbsp; There is not a single affidavit to the
contrary.&nbsp; Now what are the facts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Nimble: &ldquo;Would your lordship pardon me&mdash;whether
they are facts or not is for the jury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am coming to that, Mr. Nimble; unless contradicted
they are facts, or, at least, if you believe them, <!-- page
127--><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>gentlemen.&nbsp; If the evidence is uncontradicted,
what is the inference?&nbsp; The inference is for you, not for
me; I have simply to state the law: it is for you to find the
facts.&nbsp; You must exercise your common sense: if the prisoner
could have contradicted this evidence, is it reasonable to
suppose he would not have done so with so serious a charge
hanging over his head?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lord, may I ask how could the prisoner have called
evidence? there was no one present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Nimble,&rdquo; said his Lordship solemnly,
&ldquo;he might have shown he was elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my lord; but the prisoner admits being present: he
doesn&rsquo;t set up an <i>alibi</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen, you hear what the learned counsel says: he
admits that the prisoner was present; that is corroborative of
the story told by the prosecutrix.&nbsp; Now, if you find a
witness speaking truthfully about one part of a transaction, what
are you to infer with regard to the rest?&nbsp; Gentlemen, the
case is for you, and not for me: happily I have not to find the
facts: they are for you&mdash;and what are they?&nbsp; This
woman, who is an ironer, was going along a lonely lane,
proceeding to her home, as she states&mdash;and again I say there
is no contradiction&mdash;and she meets this man; he accosts her,
and then, according to her account, assaults her, and in a manner
which I think leaves no doubt of his intention&mdash;but that is
for you.&nbsp; I say he assaults her, if you believe her story:
of course, if you do not believe her story, then in the absence
of corroboration there would be an end of the case.&nbsp; But is
there an absence of corroboration?&nbsp; What do we find,
gentlemen?&nbsp; Now let me read to you the evidence of Police
Constable Swearhard.&nbsp; What does he say?&nbsp; &lsquo;I was
coming along the Lover&rsquo;s Lane at nine <!-- page 128--><a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>twenty-five, and I saw two persons, whom I afterwards
found to be the prosecutrix and the prisoner.&rsquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lsquo;You will mark that, gentlemen, the prisoner himself does
not suggest an <i>alibi</i>, that is to say, that he was
elsewhere, when this event occurred.&nbsp; Then he was upon the
spot: and the policeman tells you&mdash;it is for you to say
whether you believe the policeman or not; there is no suggestion
that he is not a witness of truth&mdash;and he says that he heard
a scream, and caught the defendant in the act.&nbsp; Now, from
whom did that scream proceed?&nbsp; Not from the prisoner, for it
was the scream of a woman.&nbsp; From whom then could it proceed
but from the prosecutrix?&nbsp; Now, in all cases of this kind,
one very material point has always been relied on by the Judges,
and that point is this: What was the conduct of the woman?&nbsp;
Did she go about her ordinary business as usual, or did she make
a complaint?&nbsp; If she made no complaint, or made it a long
time after, it is some evidence&mdash;not conclusive by any
means&mdash;but it is some evidence against the truth of her
story.&nbsp; Let us test this case by that theory.&nbsp; What is
the evidence of the policeman?&nbsp; I will read his words:
&lsquo;The moment I got up,&rsquo; he says, now mark that,
gentlemen, &lsquo;the woman complained of the conduct of the
prisoner: she screamed and threw herself in my arms and then
nearly fainted.&rsquo;&nbsp; Gentlemen, what does all that
mean?&nbsp; You will say by your verdict.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consider your verdict,&rdquo; said the Clerk of
Arraigns, and almost immediately the Jury said: &ldquo;Guilty of
attempt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call upon him,&rdquo; said the Judge: and he was called
upon accordingly, but only said &ldquo;the prosecutrix was a
well-known bad woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Judge said very solemnly:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prisoner at the bar, you have been convicted upon <!--
page 129--><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>the clearest possible evidence of this crime: what you
say about the character of the prosecutrix the more convinces me
that you are a very bad man.&nbsp; You not only assail the virtue
of this woman, but, happily prevented in your design, you
endeavour to destroy it afterwards in this Court.&nbsp; No one
who has heard this case can doubt that you have been guilty of
this very grave offence; and in my judgment that offence is
aggravated by the fact that you committed it against her will and
without her consent.&nbsp; The sentence is that you be sent to
prison for eighteen calendar months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather warm,&rdquo; said Mr. O&rsquo;Rapley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never heeard such a thing in my life,&rdquo; said
Master Bumpkin, &ldquo;she wur a consentin&rsquo; party if ever
there wur one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that makes no difference now-a-days,&rdquo; said
Mr. O&rsquo;Rapley.&nbsp; &ldquo;Chancery Judges studies the
equity of the thing more.&nbsp; But perhaps, Mr. Bumpkin, you
don&rsquo;t know what that means?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Bumpkin, &ldquo;I
doan&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be quiet,&rdquo; said Mr. O&rsquo;Rapley;
&ldquo;recollect you are in a Court of Justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be I!&nbsp; It &rsquo;ud take moore un thic case to
make I believe it; but lookee here: I be hanged if there
ain&rsquo;t that Snooks feller down along there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; enquired O&rsquo;Rapley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That there feller,&rdquo; said Bumpkin, &ldquo;be sure
to find his way where there&rsquo;s anything gooin on o&rsquo;
this ere natur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next an undefended prisoner was placed on trial, and as he was
supposed to know all the law of England, he was treated as if he
did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t put that question, you know,&rdquo;
said the learned Judge; &ldquo;and now you are making a
statement; <!-- page 130--><a name="page130"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 130</span>it is not time to make your
statement yet; you will have ample opportunity by-and-by in your
speech to the jury.&rdquo;&nbsp; And afterwards, when the Judge
was summing up, the unhappy prisoner called his lordship&rsquo;s
attention to a mistake; but he was told that he had had his turn
and had made his speech to the jury, and must not now interrupt
the Court.&nbsp; So he had to be quite silent until he was
convicted.&nbsp; Then the two companions went into another court,
where a very stern-looking Common Law Judge was trying a
ferocious-looking prisoner.&nbsp; And Mr. O&rsquo;Rapley was
delighted to explain that now his friend would see the
difference.&nbsp; They had entered the court just as the learned
Judge had begun to address the jury; and very careful his
lordship was to explain (not in technical language), but in
homely, common-place and common-sense English, the nature of the
crime with which the prisoner was charged.&nbsp; He was very
careful in explaining this, for fear the jury should improperly
come to the conclusion that, because they might believe the
prisoner had in fact committed the act, he must necessarily be
guilty.&nbsp; And they were told that the act was in that case
only one element of the crime, and that they must ascertain
whether there was the guilty intent or no.&nbsp; Now this old Mr.
Justice Common Sense, I thought, was very well worth listening
to, and I heartily wished Mr. Justice Technical from the Old
Court had been there to take a lesson; and I take the liberty of
setting down what I heard in my dream for the benefit of future
Justices Technical.</p>
<p>His lordship directed the jury&rsquo;s attention to the
evidence, which he carefully avoided calling facts: not to the
verbatim report of it on his note-book as some Recorders do, and
think when they are reading it over <!-- page 131--><a
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>they are
summing it up; but pointing out statements which, if believed,
become facts and if facts, lead to certain <i>inferences</i> of
guilt or innocence.</p>
<p>It was while the learned Mr. Justice Common Sense was thus
engaged, that the warder in the dock suddenly checked the
prisoner with these words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t interrupt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why may he not interrupt?&rdquo; asks Mr. Justice
Common Sense.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you want to say,
prisoner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; answered the prisoner, &ldquo;I wanted
to say as how that there witness as your lordship speaks on
didn&rsquo;t say as he seen me there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; said the Judge.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I thought he did&mdash;now let us see,&rdquo; turning over
his notes.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, you are quite right, prisoner, he did
not see you at the spot but immediately after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then his lordship proceeded until there was another
interruption of the same character, and the foolish warder again
told the prisoner to be quiet.&nbsp; This brought down Mr.
Justice Common Sense with a vengeance:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Warder! how dare you stop the prisoner? he is on his
trial and is undefended.&nbsp; Who is to check me if I am
misstating the evidence if he does not?&nbsp; If you dare to
speak like that to him again I will commit you.&nbsp; Prisoner,
interrupt me as often as you think I am not correctly stating the
evidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thankee, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That be the sort o&rsquo; Judge for me,&rdquo; said
Bumpkin; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve &rsquo;ad enough on it, Maister
O&rsquo;Rapley, so if you please, I&rsquo;ll get back t&rsquo;
the &lsquo;Goose.&rsquo;&nbsp; Why didn&rsquo;t that air Judge
try t&rsquo;other case, I wonder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; replied the Don, &ldquo;the new system
is to work the &lsquo;Round Square&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 133--><a name="page133"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 133</span>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Mr. Bumpkin&rsquo;s experience of London life,
enlarged.</p>
<p>On leaving the Old Bailey the two friends proceeded to a
neighbouring public-house and partook of some light refreshment
at the counter.&nbsp; Now Mr. Bumpkin had never yet examined the
viands displayed on a counter.&nbsp; His idea of refreshment,
when from home, had always been a huge round of beef smoking at
one end of the table and a large leg of mutton smoking at the
other, with sundry dishes of similar pretensions between, and an
immense quantity of vegetables.&nbsp; When, therefore he saw some
stale-looking sandwiches under the ordinary glass cover, he
exclaimed: &ldquo;Wittals must be mighty scarce to clap &rsquo;em
under a glass case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s to keep the flies off;&rdquo; said his
companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They need well keep un off, for there bean&rsquo;t
enough for a couple if they was ony wise ongry like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, our friends made the best of what there was, and Mr.
O&rsquo;Rapley, wishing success to his companion, enquired who
was to be his counsel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doan&rsquo;t rightly know, but I&rsquo;ll warrant Mr.
Prigg&rsquo;ll have a good un&mdash;he knows what he be about;
and all I hopes is, he&rsquo;ll rattle it into that there Snooks,
for if ever there wur a bad un it be him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looks a bad un,&rdquo; replied O&rsquo;Rapley.&nbsp;
&ldquo;When do you think the case is likely to come
on?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 134--><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>&ldquo;Well, it is supposed as it ull be on to-morrer;
but I bleeve there&rsquo;s no sartinty about thic.&nbsp; Now
then, just give us a little moore, will &rsquo;ee sir?&rdquo;
(this to the waiter).</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay for the next,&rdquo; said
O&rsquo;Rapley, feeling in his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noa, noa, I&rsquo;ll pay; and thankee, sir, for
comin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then O&rsquo;Rapley drank his friend&rsquo;s health again,
and wished further success to the case, and hoped Mr. Bumpkin
would be sure to come to him when he was at Westminster; and
expressed himself desirous to assist his friend in every way that
lay in his power&mdash;declaring that he really must be going for
he didn&rsquo;t know what would happen if the Judge should find
he was away; and was not at all certain it would not lead to some
officious member of the House of Commons asking a question of the
Prime Minister about it.</p>
<p>Mr. Bumpkin drank his good health, again and again, declaring
he was &ldquo;mighty proud to have met with un;&rdquo; and that
when the case was over and he had returned to his farm, he should
be pleased if Mr. O&rsquo;Rapley would come down and spend a few
days with him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nancy,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;&rsquo;ll be rare and pleased to see thee.&nbsp; I got as
nice a little farm as any in the county, and as pooty pigs as
thee ever clapped eyes on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. O&rsquo;Rapley, without being too condescending, expressed
himself highly gratified with making Mr. Bumpkin&rsquo;s
acquaintance, and observed that the finest pigs ever he saw were
those of the Lord Chief Justice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dade, sir, now what sort be they?&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr.
O&rsquo;Rapley was not learned in pigs, and not knowing the name
of any breed whatever, was at a loss how to describe them.&nbsp;
Mr. Bumpkin came to his assistance.</p>
<p><!-- page 135--><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>&ldquo;Be they smooth like and slim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Don.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly any hair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scarce a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They be Chichesters then&mdash;the werry best breed as
a man ever had in his stye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never see anything so pretty,&rdquo; replied Mr.
O&rsquo;Rapley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! and they be the smallest-boned pigs as ever could
be&mdash;they bean&rsquo;t got a bone bigger nor your little
finger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said the Don, finishing his glass,
&ldquo;the smaller the bone the more the meat, that&rsquo;s what
I always say; and the Lord Chief Justice don&rsquo;t care for
bone, he likes meat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; so do I&mdash;the Lud Judge be right, and if
he tries my case he&rsquo;ll know the difference betwixt thic pig
as Snooks tooked away and one o&rsquo; them
there&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jackass-looking pigs,&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Rapley,
seeing that his friend paused.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hate them jackass
pigs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I&mdash;they never puts on fat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must go, really,&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Rapley.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What do you make the right time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Bumpkin pulled out his watch with great effort, and
said it was just a quarter past four by Yokelton time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your good health again, Mr.
Bumpkin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yours, sir; and now I think on it, if it&rsquo;s a
fair question Mr. O&rsquo;Rapley, and I med ax un wirout
contempt, when do you think this &rsquo;ere case o&rsquo; mine be
likely to come on, for you ought to know summut about
un?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said the Don, partially closing one eye, and
looking profoundly into the glass as though he were <!-- page
136--><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>divining the future, &ldquo;law, sir, is a mystery and
judges is a mystery; masters is a mystery and &rsquo;sociates is
a mystery; ushers is a mystery and counsel is a
mystery;&mdash;the whole of life (here he tipped the contents of
the glass down his throat) is a mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it be,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumpkin, drawing the back of
his hand across his mouth.&nbsp; &ldquo;So it be sir, but do
&rsquo;ee think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, really,&rdquo; answered the Don, &ldquo;I should
say in about a couple of years if you ask me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How the h&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, Master Bumpkin, but contempt follers us like
a shadder: if you had said that to a Judge it would have been a
year at least: it&rsquo;s three months as it is if I liked to go
on with the case; but I&rsquo;m not a wicious man, I
hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean no offence,&rdquo; said the
farmer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, I dare say not; but still there is a way of
doing things.&nbsp; Now if you had said to me, &lsquo;Mr.
O&rsquo;Rapley, you are a gentleman moving in judicial circles,
and are probably acquainted with the windings of the,&rsquo;
&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.&nbsp; &lsquo;Can you inform me why my
case is being so unduly prolonged?&rsquo;&nbsp; Now if you had
put your question in that form I should in all probability have
answered: &lsquo;I do not see that it is unduly prolonged, Master
Bumpkin&mdash;you must have patience.&nbsp; Judges are but human
and it&rsquo;s a wonder to me they are as much as that,
seein&rsquo; what they have to go through.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if there be a Court why can&rsquo;t us get in and
try un, Mr. Rapley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, now that is putting it pointedly;&rdquo; and
O&rsquo;Rapley closed one eye and looked into his tumbler with
the other before he answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see this is how it goes under the continerous <!--
page 137--><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>sittings&mdash;off and on we sits continerously at Nisy
Prisy in London three months in the year.&nbsp; Now that
ain&rsquo;t bad for London: but it&rsquo;s nothing near so much
time as they gives to places like Aylesbury, Bedford, and many
others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bumpkin looked like a terrier dog watching a hole out of
which he expected a rat: at present he saw no sign of one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take Aylesbury; well now, if a Judge went there once in
seven years he&rsquo;d find about every other assize enough work
to last him till lunch.&nbsp; But in course two Judges must go to
Aylesbury four times a year, to do nothing but admire the
building where the Courts are held; otherwise you&rsquo;d soon
have Aylesbury marching on to London to know the reason
why.&nbsp; P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps the Judges have left five hundred
cases untried in London to go to this Aylesbury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be it a big plaace, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so big as a good-sized hotel,&rdquo; said the
Don.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
Bedford ditto again&mdash;septennel would do for that; then comes
Northampton&mdash;they don&rsquo;t want no law there at
all.&rdquo;&nbsp; (I leave the obvious pun to anyone who likes to
make it).&nbsp; &ldquo;Then Okeham again&mdash;did you ever hear
of anyone who came from Okeham?&nbsp; I never did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Don paused, as though on the answer to this question
depended his future course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noa,&rdquo; said Bumpkin, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t rightly
say as ever I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And nobody ever did come from there except the
Judges.&nbsp; Well, to Okeham they go four times a year, whereas
if they was to go about once in every hundred years it
wouldn&rsquo;t pay.&nbsp; Why raly, Mr. Bumpkin, the Judges goes
round like travellers arfter orders, and can&rsquo;t <!-- page
138--><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>get none.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not talkin&rsquo;, as you are
aware, about great centres like Liverpool, where if they had
about fifty-two assizes in the year it wouldn&rsquo;t be one too
many; but I&rsquo;m talking about circumfrences on the confines
of civilization.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear!&rdquo; sighed Bumpkin.&nbsp; The hole seemed
to him too choked up with &ldquo;larnin&rsquo;&rdquo; for the rat
ever to come out&mdash;he could glean nothing from this highly
wrought and highly polished enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, notwithstanding and accordingly,&rdquo; continued
the Don, &ldquo;they do say, goodness knows how true it is, that
they&rsquo;re going to have two more assizes in the year.&nbsp;
All that I can say is, Mr. Bumpkin&mdash;and, mark my words,
there&rsquo;ll be no stopping in London at all, but it will be
just a reg&rsquo;ler Judge&rsquo;s merry-go-round.&rdquo;&nbsp;
<a name="citation138"></a><a href="#footnote138"
class="citation">[138]</a></p>
<p>Mr. Bumpkin dropped a look into his glass, and the two
companions came out of the door and proceeded along under the
archway until they came to the corner of Bridge Street,
Blackfriars.&nbsp; Exactly at that point a young woman with a
baby in her arms came in contact with Mr. Bumpkin, and in a very
angry tone said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you what it is, don&rsquo;t you take them
liberties with me or I&rsquo;ll give you in charge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the young woman passed on with her baby.&nbsp; <!-- page
139--><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>Just at that moment, and while Master Bumpkin was
meditating on this strange conduct of the young female, he felt a
smart tug at his watch, and, looking down, saw the broken chain
hanging from his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zounds!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I never zeed
anything claner than thic; did thee zee thic feller?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he goes,&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Rapley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There ur gooes,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumpkin, and, as fast
as he could, pursued the thief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop un!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stop thic there
thief; he got my watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it was a long time before Master Bumpkin&rsquo;s mandate
was obeyed; the value of a policeman, like that of every other
commodity, depends upon his rarity.&nbsp; There was no policeman
to be found.&nbsp; There was a fire escape in the middle of the
street, but that was of no use to Master Bumpkin.&nbsp; Away went
thief, and away went Bumpkin, who could &ldquo;foot it,&rdquo; as
he said, &ldquo;pooty well, old as he wur.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nor did
either the thief or himself stop until they got nearly to the
bridge, when, to Bumpkin&rsquo;s great astonishment, up came the
thief, walking coolly towards him.&nbsp; This was another
mystery, in addition to those mentioned by Mr.
O&rsquo;Rapley.&nbsp; But the fact was, that the hue and cry was
now raised, and although Master Bumpkin did not perceive it,
about a hundred people, men, women, and boys, were in full chase;
and when that gentleman was, as Bumpkin thought, coolly coming
towards him, he was simply at bay, run down, without hope of
escape; and fully determined to face the matter out with all the
coolness he could command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take un,&rdquo; said Bumpkin; &ldquo;take un oop; thee
dam scoundrel!&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 140--><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>&ldquo;Take care what you&rsquo;re saying,&rdquo; said
the thief.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a respectable man, and
there&rsquo;s law in the land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and thee shall have un, too, thee willin; thee
stole my watch, thee knows that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a liar,&rdquo; said the captive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why thee&rsquo;s got un on, dang if thee bean&rsquo;t,
and a wearin&rsquo; on un.&nbsp; Well, this bates all; take un
oop, pleeceman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment, which is always the nick of time chosen by the
force, that is to say, when everything is done except the
handcuffs, a policeman with a great deal of authority in his
appearance came up, and plunged his hands under his heavy
coat-tails, as though he were about to deliver them of the bower
anchor of a ship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you give him in charge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure enough do ur,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumpkin.</p>
<p>So the handcuffs were put on, and the stalwart policeman, like
a hero with the captive of his bow and spear, marched him along
at a great rate, Bumpkin striding out manfully at the side, amid
a great crowd of small boys, with all their heads turned towards
the prisoner as they ran, in the highest state of delight and
excitement.&nbsp; Even Bumpkin looked as if he had made a good
thing of it, and seemed as pleased as the boys.</p>
<p>As they came again to the corner of Ludgate Hill, there stood
Mr. O&rsquo;Rapley, looking very pompous and dignified, as became
so great a man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got him then,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay; come on, Master Rapley, come on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One moment,&rdquo; said the official; &ldquo;I must
here leave you for the present, Mr. Bumpkin; we are not allowed
to give evidence in Criminal Courts any more than Her
Majesty&rsquo;s Judges themselves; we are a part of the
Court.&nbsp; <!-- page 141--><a name="page141"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 141</span>But, besides all that, I did not see
what happened; what was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumpkin, &ldquo;that be rum too,
sir; thee see thic feller steal my watch, surely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, Mr. Bumpkin, it was so quickly done that I
really did <i>not</i> see it, if you ask me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, he dragged un out o&rsquo; thic pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt, Master Bumpkin; but it does not follow that I
see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thee can come and say I wur with thee,
anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t give evidence, Mr. Bumpkin, as I told you
before; and, besides, I must not appear in this matter at
all.&nbsp; You know I was absent to oblige you, and it&rsquo;s
possible I may be of some further service to you yet; but please
don&rsquo;t mention me in this matter.&nbsp; I assure you it will
do harm, and perhaps I should lose my place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Master Rapley,&rdquo; said Bumpkin, taking his
hand, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t do thee no harm if I knows it, and
there be plenty of evidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evidence!&nbsp; You say you found the watch upon
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sartinly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The case then is clear.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t want any
evidence besides that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, you&rsquo;re a man o&rsquo;
larnin&rsquo;.&nbsp; I bean&rsquo;t much of a scollard,
I&rsquo;ll tak&rsquo; thy advice; but I must get along; they be
waitin&rsquo; for I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will see you at Westminster to-morrow, Mr.
Bumpkin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, zir, all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with that Mr. O&rsquo;Rapley proceeded on his way down
Fleet Street, and Mr. Bumpkin proceeded on his up Ludgate Hill in
the midst of an excited crowd.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">The coarse mode of procedure in Ahab <i>v.</i>
Naboth ruthlessly exposed and carefully contrasted with the
humane and enlightened form of the present day.</p>
<p>Here I awoke, and my wife said unto me, &ldquo;Dear, you have
been dreaming and talking in your sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now fearing for what I may have said, although of a tolerably
clear conscience, I enquired if she could tell me what words I
had uttered.&nbsp; She replied that I had mentioned the names of
many eminent men: such as Mr. Justice Common Sense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; quoth I; and then I told my dream.&nbsp;
Upon which she observed, that it seemed there must be much
exaggeration.&nbsp; To this I made answer that dreams do
generally magnify events, and impress them more vividly upon the
senses, inasmuch as the imagination was like a microscope: it
enabled you to see many things which would escape the naked
eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said my partner, &ldquo;if they are
distorted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they are distorted, they are not reliable; but a
clear imagination, like a good lens, faithfully presents its
objects, although in a larger form, in order that those who have
no time for scientific observation, may see what the scientist
desires to direct their attention to.&nbsp; There are creatures
almost invisible to the naked eye, which, <!-- page 144--><a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>nevertheless, cause great irritation to the
nerves.&nbsp; So, also, there are matters affecting the body
corporate of these kingdoms which the public are blind to and
suffer from, but which, if thoroughly exposed, they may be
inclined to take a hand in removing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that Mr. O&rsquo;Rapley,&rdquo;
said she: &ldquo;he seems a cantankerous, conceited
fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why so he is; but cantankerous and conceited fellows
sometimes speak the truth.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re like those
cobwebbed, unwholesome-looking bottles which have lain a long
time in cellars.&nbsp; You would hardly like to come in contact
with them, and yet they often contain a clear and beautiful
wine.&nbsp; This Mr. O&rsquo;Rapley is a worthy man who knows a
great deal, and although a bit of a toady to his superiors,
expresses his opinions pretty freely behind their
backs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what of this Master Bumpkin&mdash;this worthy
Master Bumpkin I hear you speak of so often?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very shrewd man in some respects and a silly one in
others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not an unusual combination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By no means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then I told her what I have already related; to which she
observed it was a pity some friend had not interposed and stopped
the business.&nbsp; I answered, that friends were no doubt
useful, but friends or no friends we must have law, and whether
for sixpence or a shilling it ought to be readily attainable:
that no one would be satisfied with having no other authority
than that of friendship to settle our disputes; and besides that,
friends themselves sometimes fell out and were generally the most
hard to reconcile without an appeal to our tribunals.</p>
<p><!-- page 145--><a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>&ldquo;Well, it does seem a pity,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;that judges cannot sit as they did in Moses&rsquo; time at
all seasons so as to decide expeditiously and promptly between
the claims of parties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why so they do sit &lsquo;continuously,&rsquo;&rdquo;
quoth I, &ldquo;but the whole difficulty consists in getting at
them.&nbsp; What is called procedure is so circuitous and
perplexing, that long before you get to your journey&rsquo;s end
you may faint by the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there no one with good sense who will take this
matter up and help this poor man to come by his rights.&nbsp; It
must be very expensive for him to be kept away from his business
so long, and his poor wife left all alone to manage the
farm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, so it is, but then going to law, which means
seeking to maintain your rights, is a very expensive thing: a
luxury fit only for rich men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why then do people in moderate circumstances indulge in
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because they are obliged to defend themselves against
oppressive and unjust demands; although I think, under the
present system, if a man had a small estate, say a few acres, and
a rich man laid claim to it, it would be far better for the small
man to give up the land without any bother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But no man of spirit would do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that is exactly where it is, it&rsquo;s the spirit
of resistance that comes in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Resistance! a man would be a coward to yield without a
fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why so he would, and that is what makes law such a
beautiful science, and its administration so costly.&nbsp; Men
will fight to the last rather than give in.&nbsp; If Naboth had
lived in these times there would have been no need <!-- page
146--><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>of
his death in order to oust him from his vineyard.&nbsp; Ahab
could have done a much more sensible thing and walked in by
process of law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the first place he could have laid claim to a right
of way, or easement as it is called, of some sort: or could have
alleged that Naboth had encroached on his land by means of a
fence or drain or ditch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but if he hadn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he hadn&rsquo;t, so much the better for the
Plaintiff, and so much the worse for Naboth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand; if Naboth had done no wrong,
surely it would be far better for him than if he had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the long run, my dear: and for this reason, if
he had encroached it would have taken very little trouble to
ascertain the fact, and Naboth being a just and honest man, would
only require to have it pointed out to him to remedy the
evil.&nbsp; Maps and plans of the estate would doubtless have
shown him his mistake, and, like a wise man, he would have
avoided going to law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see clearly that the good man would have said,
&lsquo;Neighbour Ahab, we have been on neighbourly terms for a
long lime, and I do not wish in any way to alter that excellent
feeling which has always subsisted between us.&nbsp; I see
clearly by these maps and plans which worthy Master Metefield
hath shown me that my hedge hath encroached some six inches upon
thy domain, wherefore, Neighbour Ahab, take, I pray thee, as much
of the land as belongeth unto thee, according to just
admeasurement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why certainly, so would the honest Naboth have communed
with Ahab, and there would have been an end of the
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 147--><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>&ldquo;But show me, darling, how being in the wrong was
better for good Naboth than being in the right in this
business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most willingly,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;you see, my dear,
there was quickly an end of the matter by Naboth yielding to the
just demands of neighbour Ahab.&nbsp; But now let us suppose
honest Naboth in the right concerning his vineyard, and neighbour
Ahab to be making an unjust demand.&nbsp; You have already most
justly observed that in that case it would be cowardly on the
part of Naboth to yield without a struggle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Assuredly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, that means a lawsuit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But surely,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;it ought to be
soon seen who is in the wrong.&nbsp; Where is Master Metefield
who you said just now was so accurate a surveyor, and where are
those plans you spoke of which showed the situation of the
estates?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, my dear, I see you know very little of the
intricacies of the law; that good Master Metefield, instead of
being a kind of judge to determine quickly as he did for Master
Naboth what were the boundaries of the vineyard, hath not now so
easy a task of it, because Ahab being in the wrong he is not
accepted by him as his judge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if the plans are correct, how can he alter
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He cannot alter them, but the question of correctness
of boundary as shown, is matter of disputation, and will have to
be discussed by surveyors on both sides, and supported and
disputed by witnesses innumerable on both sides: old men coming
up with ancient memories, hedgers and ditchers, farmers and
bailiffs and people of all <!-- page 148--><a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>sorts and
conditions, to prove and disprove where the boundary line really
divides Neighbour Naboth&rsquo;s vineyard from Neighbour
Ahab&rsquo;s park.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But surely Naboth will win?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All that depends upon a variety of things, such as,
first, the witnesses; secondly, the counsel; thirdly, the judge;
fourthly, the jury,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;pray don&rsquo;t go on
to a fifthly&mdash;it seems to me poor Naboth is like to have a
sorry time of it before he establish his boundary
line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, if he ever do so: but he first is got into the
hands of his Lawyers, next into the hands of his Counsel,
thirdly, into Chancery, fourthly, into debt&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray, do not let us have a fifthly here either; I like
not these thirdlys and fourthlys, for they seem to bring poor
Naboth into bad case; but what said you about debt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say that Naboth, not being a wealthy man, but, as I
take it, somewhat in the position of neighbour Bumpkin, will soon
be forced to part with a good deal of his little property in
order to carry on the action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But will not the action be tried in a reasonable time,
say a week or two?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I perceive,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;that you are yet in
the very springtide and babyhood of innocence in these
matters.&nbsp; There must be summonses for time and for further
time; there must be particulars and interrogatories and
discoveries and inspections and strikings out and puttings in and
appeals and demurrers and references and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, please don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I perceive that poor
Naboth is already ruined a long way back.&nbsp; I think when you
came to the interrogatories he was in want of funds to carry on
the action.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 149--><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>&ldquo;A Chancery action sometimes takes years,&rdquo;
said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Years! then shame to our Parliament.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I pray you do not take on so,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Naboth, according to the decree of Fate, is to be
ruined.&nbsp; Jezebel did it in a wicked, clumsy and brutal
manner.&nbsp; Anyone could see she was wrong, and her name has
been handed down to us with infamy and execration.&nbsp; I now
desire to show how Ahab could have accomplished his purpose in a
gentle, manly and scientific manner and saved his wife&rsquo;s
reputation.&nbsp; Naboth&rsquo;s action, carried as it would be
from Court to Court upon every possible point upon which an
appeal can go, under our present system, would effectually ruin
him ages before the boundary line could be settled.&nbsp; It
would be all swallowed up in costs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Naboth!&rdquo; said my wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; continued I, &ldquo;the law reports would
hand down the <i>cause celebre</i> of <i>Ahab</i> v.
<i>Naboth</i> as a most interesting leading case upon the subject
of goodness knows what: perhaps as to whether a man, under
certain circumstances, may not alter his neighbour&rsquo;s
landmark in spite of the statute law of Moses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so you think poor Naboth would be sold
up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That were about the only certain event in his case,
except that Ahab would take possession and so put an end for ever
to the question as to where the boundary line should
run.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here again I dozed.</p>
<h2><!-- page 151--><a name="page151"></a><span

<p class="gutsumm">Shewing that lay tribunals are not exactly
Punch and Judy shows where the puppet is moved by the man
underneath.</p>
<p>It was particularly fortunate for Mr. Bumpkin that his case
was not in the list of causes to be tried on the following
day.&nbsp; It may seem a curious circumstance to the general
reader that a great case like <i>Bumpkin</i> v. <i>Snooks</i>,
involving so much expense of time, trouble, and money should be
in the list one day and out the next; should be sometimes in the
list of one Court and sometimes in the list of another; flying
about like a butterfly from flower to flower and caught by no one
on the look-out for it.&nbsp; But this is not a phenomenon in our
method of procedure, which startles you from time to time with
its miraculous effects.&nbsp; You can calculate upon nothing in
the system but its uncertainty.&nbsp; Most gentle and innocent
reader, I saw that there was no Nisi Prius Court to sit on the
following day, so <i>Bumpkin</i> v. <i>Snooks</i> could not be
taken, list or no list.&nbsp; The lucky Plaintiff therefore found
himself at liberty to appear before that August Tribunal which
sits at the Mansion House in the City of London.&nbsp; A palatial
and imposing building it was on the outside, but within, so far
as was apparent to me, it was a narrow ill ventilated den, full
of all unclean people and unpleasant smells.&nbsp; I say full of
<!-- page 152--><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>unclean people, but I allude merely to that portion of
it which was appropriated to the British Public; for, exalted on
a high bench and in a huge and ponderous chair or throne sat the
Prince of Citizens and the King of the Corporation, proud in his
dignity, grand in his commercial position, and highly esteemed in
the opinion of the world.&nbsp; There he sat, the representative
of the Criminal Law, and impartial, as all will allow, in its
administration.&nbsp; Wonderful being is my Lord Mayor, thought
I, he must have the Law at his fingers&rsquo; ends.&nbsp; Yes,
there it is sitting under him in the shape and person of his
truly respectable clerk.&nbsp; The Common Law resides in the
breasts of the Judges, but it is here at my Lord Mayor&rsquo;s
fingers&rsquo; ends.&nbsp; He has to deal with gigantic
commercial frauds; with petty swindlers, common thieves; mighty
combinations of conspirators; with extradition laws; with
elaborate bankruptcy delinquencies; with the niceties of the
criminal law in every form and shape.&nbsp; Surely, thought I, he
should be one of those tremendous geniuses who can learn the
criminal law before breakfast, or at least before dinner!&nbsp;
So he was.&nbsp; His lordship seemed to have learned it one
morning before he was awake.&nbsp; But it is not for me to
criticise tribunals or men: I have the simple duty to perform of
relating the story of the renowned Mr. Bumpkin.</p>
<p>After the night charges are disposed of up comes the man
through the floor, not Mr. Bumpkin, but Mr. Bumpkin&rsquo;s
prisoner.&nbsp; He comes up through the floor like the imp in the
pantomime: and then the two tall warders prevent his going any
farther.</p>
<p>He was a pale, intelligent looking creature, fairly dressed in
frock coat, dark waistcoat and grey trousers, with a glove on his
left hand and another in his right; <!-- page 153--><a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>looked
meekly and modestly round, and then politely bowed to the Lord
Mayor.&nbsp; The charge was then read to him and with a smile he
indignantly repudiated the idea of theft.</p>
<p>And I saw in my dream that he was represented by a learned
Counsel, who at this moment entered the Court, shook hands with
the Lord Mayor, and saying, &ldquo;I appear, my lord, for the
prisoner,&rdquo; took his seat upon the bench, and entered for a
minute or so into some private and apparently jocular
conversation with his Lordship.</p>
<p>The name of the learned Counsel was Mr. Nimble, whom we have
before seen.&nbsp; He was a very goodly-shaped man, with a thin
face and brown hair.&nbsp; His eyes were bright, and always
seemed to look into a witness rather than at him.&nbsp; His
manner was jaunty, good-natured, easy, and gay; not remarkable
for courtesy, but at the same time, not unpleasantly rude.&nbsp;
I thought the learned Counsel could be disagreeable if he liked,
but might be a very pleasant, sociable fellow to spend an hour
with&mdash;not in the witness-box.</p>
<p>He was certainly a skilful and far-seeing Counsel, if I may
make so bold as to judge from this case.&nbsp; And methought that
nothing he did or said was said or done without a purpose.&nbsp;
Nor could I help thinking that a good many Counsel, young and
old, if their minds were free from prejudice, might learn many
lessons from this case.&nbsp; It is with this object that, in my
waking moments, I record the impressions of this dream.&nbsp; I
do not say Mr. Nimble was an example to follow on all points, for
he had that common failing of humanity, a want of absolute
perfection.&nbsp; But he was as near to perfection in defending a
prisoner as any man I ever saw, and the proceedings in <!-- page
154--><a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>this very case, if carefully analysed, will go a long
way towards proving that assertion.</p>
<p>After the interchange of courtesies between his Lordship and
Mr. Nimble, the learned Counsel looked down from the Bench on to
the top of Mr. Keepimstraight&rsquo;s bald head and nodded as if
he were patting it.&nbsp; Mr. Keepimstraight was the Lord
Mayor&rsquo;s Clerk.&nbsp; He was very stout and seemed puffed up
with law: had an immense regard for himself and consequently very
little for anybody else: but that, so far as I have been able to
ascertain, is a somewhat common failing among official
personages.&nbsp; He ordered everybody about except the Lord
Mayor, and him he seemed to push about as though he were wheeling
him in a legal Bath-chair.&nbsp; His Lordship was indeed a great
invalid in respect to matters of law; I think he had overdone it,
if I may use the expression; his study must have been tremendous
to have acquired a knowledge of the laws of England in so short a
time.&nbsp; But being somewhat feeble, and in his modesty much
misdoubting his own judgment, he did nothing and said nothing,
except it was prescribed by his physician, Dr.
Keepimstraight.&nbsp; Even the solicitors stood in awe of Dr.
Keepimstraight.</p>
<p>And now we are all going to begin&mdash;Walk up!</p>
<p>The intelligent and decent-looking prisoner having been told
what the charge against him was, namely, Highway Robbery with
violence, declares that he is as &ldquo;innercent as the unborn
babe, your lordship:&rdquo; and then Mr. Keepimstraight asks,
where the Prosecutor is&mdash;&ldquo;Prosecutor!&rdquo; shout a
dozen voices at once&mdash;all round, everywhere is the cry of
&ldquo;Prosecutor!&rdquo;&nbsp; There was no answer, but in the
midst of the unsavoury crowd there was seen to be a severe
scuffle&mdash;whether it was a fight or <!-- page 155--><a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>a man in a
fit could not be ascertained for some time; at length Mr. Bumpkin
was observed struggling and tearing to escape from the
throng.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you come when you are called?&rdquo;
asks the Junior Clerk, handing him the Testament, as Mr. Bumpkin
stood revealed in the witness-box.</p>
<p>And I saw that he was dressed in a light frock, not unlike a
pinafore, which was tastefully wrought with divers patterns of
needlework on the front and back thereof; at the openings thus
embroidered could be seen a waistcoat of many stripes, that
crossed and recrossed one another at various angles and were
formed of several colours.&nbsp; He wore a high calico shirt
collar, which on either side came close under the ear; and round
his neck a red handkerchief with yellow ends.&nbsp; His linen
certainly did credit to Mrs. Bumpkin&rsquo;s love of
&ldquo;tidiness,&rdquo; and altogether the prosecutor wore a
clean and respectable appearance.&nbsp; His face was broad, round
and red, indicating a jovial disposition and a temperament not
easily disturbed, except when &ldquo;whate&rdquo; was down too
low to sell and he wanted to buy stock or pay the rent: a state
of circumstances which I believe has sometimes happened of late
years.&nbsp; A white short-clipped beard covered his chin, while
his cheeks were closely shaven.&nbsp; He had twinkling oval eyes,
which I should say, he invariably half-closed when he was making
a bargain.&nbsp; If you offered less than his price the first
refusal would come from them.&nbsp; His nose was inexpressive and
appeared to have been a dormant feature for many a year.&nbsp; It
said nothing for or against any thing or any body, and from its
tip sprouted a few white hairs.&nbsp; His mouth, without
utterance, said plainly enough that he owed &ldquo;nobody
nothink&rdquo; and was a thousand pound man every morning <!--
page 156--><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>he rose.&nbsp; It was a mouth of good bore, and not by
any means intended for a silver spoon.</p>
<p>Such was the Prosecutor as he stood in the witness-box at the
Mansion House on this memorable occasion; and no one could doubt
that truth and justice would prevail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Name?&rdquo; said Mr. Keepimstraight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bumpkin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Down it goes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a pause, which Mr. Nimble makes a note of.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; repeats Keepimstraight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Westminister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Goose&rsquo; publichouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Down it goes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; says Keepimstraight.</p>
<p>Bumpkin stares.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, go on,&rdquo; says the clerk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; says the crier; &ldquo;go on,&rdquo; say
half-a-dozen voices all round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you go on?&rdquo; says the clerk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell your story,&rdquo; says his Lordship, putting his
arms on the elbows of the huge chair.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell it in
your own way, my man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wur gwine down thic place when&mdash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;my man&rdquo; began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time was this?&rdquo; asks the clerk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arf arter four, as near as I can tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; asks the clerk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I object,&rdquo; says the
Counsel&mdash;&ldquo;can&rsquo;t tell us what he
heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I perceived that the Lord Mayor leant forward <!-- page
157--><a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>towards Mr. Keepimstraight, and the latter gentleman
turned his head and leaned towards the Lord Mayor, so that his
Lordship could obtain a full view of Mr. Keepimstraight&rsquo;s
eyes.</p>
<p>Then I perceived that Mr. Keepimstraight winked his left eye
and immediately turned to his work again, and his Lordship
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think what you heard, witness, is
evidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t have that,&rdquo; said Mr. Keepimstraight,
as though he took his instructions and the Law from his
Lordship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said it was half-past four.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heard the clock strike th&rsquo; arf hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here his Lordship leant again forward and Mr. Keepimstraight
turned round so as to bring his eyes into the same position as
heretofore.&nbsp; And I perceived that Mr. Keepimstraight winked
his right eye, upon which his Lordship said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s evidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clerk whispered, behind his hand, &ldquo;Can hardly exclude
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can hardly exclude that,&rdquo; repeats his Lordship;
then&mdash;turning to the Learned
Counsel&mdash;&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t shut that out, Mr.
Nimble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seldom can shut a church clock out, my Lord,&rdquo;
replies the Counsel.</p>
<p>At this answer his Lordship smiled and the Court was convulsed
with laughter for several minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then,&rdquo; said Mr. Keepimstraight, &ldquo;we
must have order in Court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must have order in Court,&rdquo; says his
Lordship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Order in Court,&rdquo; says the Junior Clerk, and
&ldquo;Order!&rdquo; shouts the Policeman on duty.</p>
<p>Then Mr. Bumpkin stated in clear and intelligible <!-- page
158--><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>language how the man came up and took his watch and ran
away.&nbsp; Foolishly enough he said nothing about the woman with
the baby, and wisely enough Mr. Nimble asked nothing about
it.&nbsp; But what an opportunity this would have been for an
unskilful Counsel to lay the foundation for a conviction.&nbsp;
Knowing, as he probably would from the prisoner but from no other
possible source about the circumstance, he might have shown by a
question or two that it was a conspiracy between the prisoner and
the young woman.&nbsp; Not so Mr. Nimble, he knew how to make an
investment of this circumstance for future profit: indeed Mr.
Bumpkin had invested it for him by not mentioning it.&nbsp;
Beautiful is Advocacy if you do not mar it by unskilful
handling.</p>
<p>When, after describing the robbery, the prosecutor
continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ses to my companion, ses I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I object,&rdquo; says Mr. Nimble.</p>
<p>And I perceived that his Lordship leant forward once more
towards Mr. Keepimstraight, and Mr. Keepimstraight turned as
aforetime towards the Lord Mayor, but not quite, I thought, so
fully round as heretofore; the motion seemed to be performed with
less exactness than usual, and that probably was why the
operation miscarried.&nbsp; Mr. Keepimstraight having given the
correct signal, as he thought, and the Enginedriver on the Bench
having misunderstood it, an accident naturally would have taken
place but for the extreme caution and care of his Lordship, who,
if he had been a young Enginedriver, would in all probability
have dashed on neck or nothing through every obstacle.&nbsp; Not
so his Lordship.&nbsp; Not being sure whether he was on the up or
down line, he pulled up.</p>
<p><!-- page 159--><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>Mr. Keepimstraight sat pen in hand looking at his
paper, and waiting for the judicial voice which should convey to
his ear the announcement that &ldquo;I ses, ses I,&rdquo; is
evidence or no evidence.&nbsp; Judge then of Mr.
Keepimstraight&rsquo;s disappointment when, after waiting in
breathless silence for some five minutes, he at last looks up and
sees his Lordship in deep anxiety to catch his eye without the
public observing it.&nbsp; His Lordship leant forward, blushing
with innocence, and whispered something behind his hand to Mr.
Keepimstraight.&nbsp; And in my dream I heard his Lordship
ask:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Which eye</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To which Mr. Keepimstraight as coolly as if nothing had
happened, whispered behind his hand:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Left</i>!&rdquo; and then coughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O then,&rdquo; exclaimed his Lordship, &ldquo;it is
clearly not evidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not evidence,&rdquo; repeated the clerk; and
then to the discomfiture of Mr. Nimble, he went on, &ldquo;You
say you had a companion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was more than the learned Counsel wanted, seeing as he
did that there was another investment to be made if he could only
manage it.</p>
<p>Mr. Bumpkin blushed now, but said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you excuse me,&rdquo; said Mr. Nimble; &ldquo;I
shall not cross-examine this witness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, very good,&rdquo; says Keepimstraight, thinking
probably it was to be a plea of guilty hereafter; &ldquo;very
good.&nbsp; Then I think that is all&mdash;is that the
watch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It be,&rdquo; said the witness; &ldquo;I ken swear to
un.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It certainly would be from no want of metal if Mr. Bumpkin
could not identify the timepiece, for it was a ponderous-looking
watch, nearly as large as a tea-saucer.</p>
<p><!-- page 160--><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>Then said Mr. Nimble:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say that is your watch, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It spakes for itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s evidence,&rdquo; says
Mr. Keepimstraight, with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s clearly not evidence,&rdquo; says the Lord
Mayor, gravely.&nbsp; Whereupon there was another burst of
laughter, in which the clerk seemed to take the lead.&nbsp; The
remarkable fact, however, was, that his Lordship was perfectly at
a loss to comprehend the joke.&nbsp; He was &ldquo;as grave as a
Judge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the laughter had subsided, the learned Keepimstraight
leaned backward, and the learned Lord Mayor leaned forward, and
it seemed to me they were conversing together about the cause of
the laughter; for suddenly a smile illuminated the rubicund face
of the cheery Lord Mayor, and at last he had a laugh to
himself&mdash;a solo, after the band had ceased.&nbsp; And then
his Lordship spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What your watch may say is not evidence, because it has
not been sworn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the band struck up again to a lively tune, his Lordship
playing the first Fiddle; and the whole scene terminated in the
most humorous and satisfactory manner for all
parties&mdash;<i>except</i>, perhaps, the prisoner&mdash;who was
duly committed for trial to the next sittings of the Central
Criminal Court, which were to take place in a fortnight.</p>
<p>Mr. Bumpkin naturally asked for his watch, but that request
was smilingly refused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bin in our famly forty years,&rdquo; exclaimed the
prisoner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you be quiet?&rdquo; said Mr. Nimble petulantly,
for it was a foolish observation for the prisoner to make,
inasmuch <!-- page 161--><a name="page161"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 161</span>as, if Mr. Bumpkin had been
represented by professional skill, the remark would surely be met
at the trial with abundant evidence to disprove it.&nbsp; Mr.
Bumpkin at present, however, has no professional skill.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Here something disturbed me, and I awoke.&nbsp; While
preparing to enjoy my pipe as was my custom in these intervals,
my wife remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not approve of that Master O&rsquo;Rapley by any
means, with his cynicisms and sarcasms and round squares.&nbsp;
Did ever anyone hear of such a contradiction?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have patience,&rdquo; quoth I, &ldquo;and we shall see
how worthy Master O&rsquo;Rapley makes it out.&nbsp; I conjecture
that he means the same thing that we hear of under the term,
&lsquo;putting the round peg into the square
hole.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why should such a thing be done when it is easy
surely to find a square peg that would fit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Granted; but the master-hand may be under obligations
to the round peg; or the round peg may be a disagreeable peg, or
a hundred things: one doesn&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; I am but a humble
observer of human nature, and like not these ungracious
cavillings at Master O&rsquo;Rapley.&nbsp; Let us calmly follow
this dream, and endeavour to profit by its lessons without
finding fault with its actors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I would like to have a better explanation of that
Round Square, nevertheless,&rdquo; muttered my wife as she went
on with her knitting.&nbsp; So to appease her I discoursed as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The round square,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;means the
inappropriate combination of opposites.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, not too long words,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and
not too much philosophy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, my dear,&rdquo; I continued; &ldquo;Don
O&rsquo;Rapley <!-- page 162--><a name="page162"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 162</span>is right, not in his particular
instance, but in the general application of his meaning.&nbsp;
Look around upon the world, or so much of it as is comprised
within our own limited vision, and what do you find?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I find everything,&rdquo; said my wife,
&ldquo;beautifully ordered and arranged, from the Archbishop of
Canterbury to the Parish Beadle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you find?&rdquo; I repeated.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mark
the O&rsquo;Rapley&rsquo;s knowledge of human nature, you not
only find Waterloos won in the Cricket-field of Eton, but
Bishopricks and Secretaryships and many other glorious victories;
so that you might&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be foolish; Trafalgar was not won in the
Cricket-field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but it was fought on the Isis or the Cam, I forget
which.&nbsp; But carry the O&rsquo;Rapley&rsquo;s theory into
daily life, and test it by common observation, what do you
find?&nbsp; Why, that this round square is by no means a modern
invention.&nbsp; It has been worked in all periods of our
history.&nbsp; Here is a Vicar with a rich benefice, intended by
nature for a Jockey or a Whipper-in&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, the benefice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, the Vicar!&nbsp; Here is a barrister who ought to
have been a curate, and become enthusiastic over worked slippers:
there is another thrust into a Government appointment, not out of
respect to him, the Minister doesn&rsquo;t know him, but to serve
a political friend, or to place an investment in the hands of a
political rival, who will return it with interest on a future
day.&nbsp; The gentleman thus provided for at the country&rsquo;s
expense would, if left to himself, have probably become an
excellent billiard-marker or pigeon-shooter.&nbsp; Here is
another, <!-- page 163--><a name="page163"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 163</span>who, although a member of
Parliament, was elected by no constituency under Heaven or above
it; and it is clear he was intended by Nature for a position
where obsequiousness and servility meet with their appropriate
reward.&nbsp; Another fills the post of some awful Commissioner
of something, drawing an immense salary, and doing an immense
amount of mischief for it, intended naturally for a secretary to
an Autocratic Nobleman, who would trample the rights of the
people under foot.&nbsp; Here is another&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O pray, my dear, do not let us have
another&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one more,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;here is another,
thrust into the Cabinet for being so disagreeable a fellow, who
ought to have been engaged in making fireworks for Crystal Palace
f&ecirc;tes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this is only an opinion of yours; how do you know
these gentlemen are not fitted for the posts they occupy? surely
if they do the work&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The public would have no right to grumble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as for obsequiousness and servility, I am afraid
those are epithets too often unjustly applied to those gentlemen
whose courteous demeanour wins them the respect of their
superiors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t see
that it matters what is the distinguishing epithet you apply to
them: this courteous demeanour or obsequiousness is no doubt the
very best gift Nature can bestow upon an individual as an outfit
for the voyage of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me, you were complaining but just now of its
placing men in positions for which they were not
qualified.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not complaining, my love; only remarking.&nbsp; I go in
for obsequiousness, and trust I shall never be found <!-- page
164--><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>wanting in that courteous demeanour towards my
superiors which shall lead to my future profit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But would you have men only courteous?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By no means, I would have them talented
also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But in what proportion would you have the one to the
other?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would have the same proportion maintained that exists
between the rudder and the ship: you want just enough tact to
steer your obsequiousness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here again I dozed.</p>
<h2><!-- page 165--><a name="page165"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 165</span>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">A comfortable evening at the Goose</p>
<p>When Mr. Bumpkin left the Mansion House, he was in a state of
great triumph not to say ecstasy: for it seemed to him that he
had had everything his own way.&nbsp; He was not cross-examined;
no witnesses were called, and it had only been stated by the
prisoner himself, not proved, although he said he should prove it
at the trial, that the watch had been in the family for upwards
of forty years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The biggest lie,&rdquo; muttered Master Bumpkin,
&ldquo;that ever wur told.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then he reasoned in
this wise: &ldquo;how could it a bin in his family forty year
when he, Bumpkin, only lost it the day afore in the most
barefaced manner?&nbsp; He was a pooty feller as couldn&rsquo;t
tell a better story than thic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then methought in my dream, &ldquo;Ah, Bumpkin, thou
may&rsquo;st triumph now, but little dreamest thou what is in
store for thee at the trial.&nbsp; Wait till all those little
insignificant points, hardly visible at present, shall rise, like
spear-heads against thee at the Old Bailey and thrust thee
through and through and make thee curse the advocate&rsquo;s
skill and the thief&rsquo;s impudence and the inertness of the
so-called Public Prosecutor: and mayhap, I know not yet, show
thee how wrong and robbery may triumph over right and
innocence.&nbsp; Thou <!-- page 166--><a name="page166"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 166</span>hast raised thyself, good Bumpkin,
from the humblest poverty to comparative wealth and a lawsuit:
but boast not overmuch lest thou find Law a taskmaster instead of
a Protector!</p>
<p>Thus, moralizing in my dream I perceived that Mr. Bumpkin
after talking to some men betook himself to a Bus and proceeded
on his way to the &ldquo;Goose&rdquo; at Westminster, whither he
arrived in due time and in high spirits.</p>
<p>The Goose was a nice cosy public-house, situated, as I before
observed, near the river side and commanded a beautiful view of
the neighbouring wharves and the passing craft.&nbsp; It was a
favourite resort of waterside men, carters, carriers, labourers
on the wharf and men out of work.&nbsp; The Military also
patronized it:&mdash;And many were the jovial tales told around
the taproom hearth by members of Her Majesty&rsquo;s troops to
admiring and astonished Ignorance.</p>
<p>It was a particularly cold and bleak day, this ninth of March
one thousand eight hundred and something.&nbsp; The wind was due
East and accompanied ever and anon with mighty thick clouds of
sleet and snow.&nbsp; The fireside therefore was particularly
comfortable, and the cheery faces around the hearth were pleasant
to behold.</p>
<p>Now Mr. Bumpkin, as the reader knows, was not alone in his
expedition.&nbsp; He had his witness, named Joseph Wurzel: called
in the village &ldquo;Cocky,&rdquo; inasmuch as it was generally
considered that he set much by his wisdom: and was possessed of
considerable attainments.&nbsp; For instance, he could snare a
hare as well as any man in the county: or whistle down pheasants
to partake of a Buckwheat refection which he was in the habit of
spreading for their repast.</p>
<p><!-- page 167--><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
167</span>A good many fellows who were envious of Joe&rsquo;s
abilities avowed that &ldquo;he was a regler cunnin&rsquo;
feller, as ud some day find out his mistake;&rdquo; meaning
thereby that Joe would inevitably be sent to prison.&nbsp; Others
affirmed that he was a good deal too cunning for that; that he
was a regular artful dodger, and knew how to get round the vicar
and all in authority under him.&nbsp; The reader knows that he
was a regular attendant at Church, and by that means was in high
favour.&nbsp; Nor was his mother behind hand in this respect,
especially in the weeks before Christmas; and truly her religion
brought its reward even in this world in the shape of Parish
Gifts.</p>
<p>No doubt Joe was fond of the chase, but in this respect he but
imitated his superiors, except that I believe he occasionally
went beyond them in the means he employed.</p>
<p>Assembled in this common room at the Goose on the night in
question, were a number of persons of various callings and some
of no calling in particular.&nbsp; Most of them were acquainted,
and apparently regular customers.&nbsp; One man in particular
became a great favourite with Joe, and that was Jacob Wideawake
the Birdcatcher; and it was interesting to listen to his
conversation on the means of catching and transforming the London
Sparrow into an article of Commerce.</p>
<p>Joe&rsquo;s dress no doubt attracted the attention of his
companions when he first made his appearance, for it was
something out of the ordinary style: and certainly one might say
that great care had been bestowed upon him to render his personal
appearance attractive in the witness-box.&nbsp; He wore a
wideawake hat thrown back on his head, thus displaying his brown
country-looking face to full advantage.&nbsp; His coat was a kind
of dark velveteen <!-- page 168--><a name="page168"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 168</span>which had probably seen better days
in the Squire&rsquo;s family; so had the long drab
waistcoat.&nbsp; His corduroy trousers, of a light green colour,
were hitched up at the knees with a couple of straps as though he
wore his garters outside.&nbsp; His neckerchief was a bright red,
tied round his neck in a careless but not unpicturesque
manner.&nbsp; Take him for all in all he was as fine a specimen
of a country lad as one could wish to meet,&mdash;tall, well
built, healthy looking, and even handsome.</p>
<p>Now Mr. Bumpkin, being what is called &ldquo;a close
man,&rdquo; and prone to keep his own counsel on all occasions
when it was not absolutely necessary to reveal it, had said
nothing about his case before the Lord Mayor; not even Mrs.
Oldtimes had he taken into his confidence.&nbsp; It is difficult
to understand his motive for such secrecy, as it is impossible to
trace in nine instances out of ten any particular line of human
conduct to its source.</p>
<p>Acting probably on some vague information that he had
received, Mr. Bumpkin looked into the room, and told Joe that he
thought they should be &ldquo;on&rdquo; to-morrow.&nbsp; He had
learned the use of that legal term from frequent intercourse with
Mr. Prigg.&nbsp; He thought they should be on but &ldquo;wur not
sartin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Joe, &ldquo;the sooner the
better.&nbsp; I hates this ere hangin&rsquo; about.&rdquo;&nbsp;
At this Jack Outofwork, Tom Lazyman, and Bill Saunter laughed;
while Dick Devilmecare said, &ldquo;He hated hanging about too;
it was wus than work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s bad enough, Heaven knows,&rdquo; said
Lazyman.</p>
<p>Then I saw that at this moment entered a fine tall handsome
soldier, who I afterwards learned was Sergeant Goodtale of the
One Hundred and twenty-fourth <!-- page 169--><a
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>Hussars.&nbsp; A smarter or more compact looking fellow
it would be impossible to find: and he came in with such a
genial, good-natured smile, that to look at him would almost make
you believe there was no happiness or glory on this side the
grave except in Her Majesty&rsquo;s service&mdash;especially the
Hussars!</p>
<p>I also perceived that fluttering from the side of Sergeant
Goodtale&rsquo;s cap, placed carelessly and jauntily on the side
of his head, was a bunch of streamers of the most fascinating red
white and blue you ever could behold.&nbsp; Altogether, Sergeant
Goodtale was a splendid sight.&nbsp; Down went his cane on the
table with a crack, as much as to say &ldquo;The Queen!&rdquo;
and he marched up to the fire and rubbed his hands: apparently
taking no heed of any human being in the room.</p>
<p>Mr. Bumpkin&rsquo;s heart leaped when he saw the military
sight: his eyes opened as if he were waking from a dream out of
which he had been disturbed by a cry of &ldquo;fire:&rdquo; and
giving Joe a wink and an obviously made-up look, beckoned him out
of the room.&nbsp; As they went out they met a young man,
shabbily clad and apparently poorly fed.&nbsp; He had an
intelligent face, though somewhat emaciated.&nbsp; He might be,
and probably was, a clerk out of employment, and he threw himself
on the seat in a listless manner that plainly said he was tired
of everything.</p>
<p>This was Harry Highlow.&nbsp; He had been brought up with
ideas beyond his means.&nbsp; It was through no fault of his that
he had not been taught a decent trade: those responsible for his
training having been possessed of the notion that manual labour
lowers one&rsquo;s respectability: an error and a wickedness
which has been responsible for the ruin of many a promising youth
before to-day.</p>
<p><!-- page 170--><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>Harry was an intelligent, fairly educated youth, and
nothing more.&nbsp; What is to be done with raw material so
plentiful as that?&nbsp; The cheapest marketable commodity is an
average education, especially in a country where even our
Universities can supply you with candidates for employment at a
cheaper rate than you can obtain the services of a first-class
cook.&nbsp; This young man had tried everything that was genteel:
he had even aspired to literature: sought employment on the
Press, on the Stage, everywhere in fact where gentility seemed to
reign.&nbsp; Nor do I think he lacked ability for any of these
walks; it was not ability but opportunity that failed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lookee ere, Joe,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumpkin; &ldquo;harken
to me.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t thee &rsquo;ave nowt to say to that
there soger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, maister,&rdquo; said Joe, laughing;
&ldquo;thee thinks I be gwine for a soger.&nbsp; Now lookee ere,
maister, I beant a fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thee beant, Joe.&nbsp; I knowed thee a good while,
and thee beant no fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe laughed.&nbsp; It was a big laugh was Joe&rsquo;s, for his
mouth was somewhat large, and a grin always seemed to twist
it.&nbsp; On this occasion, so great was his surprise that his
master should think he would be fool enough to enlist for a
&ldquo;soger,&rdquo; that his mouth assumed the most irregular
shape I ever saw, and bore a striking resemblance to a hole such
as might be made in the head of a drum by the heel of a boot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I be up to un, maister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have no truck wi&rsquo; un, I tell ee; don&rsquo;t
speak to un.&nbsp; Thee be my head witness, and doant dare goo
away; no, no more un if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No fear,&rdquo; said Joe.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Taint
likely I be gwine to <!-- page 171--><a name="page171"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 171</span>listen to ee.&nbsp; I knows what he
wants; he&rsquo;s arter listin chaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look ee ere, Joe, if ur speaks to thee, jist say I
beant sich a fool as I looks; that&rsquo;ll ave un.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; says Joe; &ldquo;I beant sich a fool as I
looks; that&rsquo;ll ave un straight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, take heed; I&rsquo;m gwine into the parlour
wi&rsquo; Landlord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly, into the little quiet snuggery of Mr. Oldtimes,
Mr. Bumpkin betook himself.&nbsp; And many and many an agreeable
evening was passed with Mr. and Mrs. Oldtimes during the period
when Mr. Bumpkin was waiting for his trial.&nbsp; For Mr. and
Mrs. Oldtimes being Somersetshire people knew many inhabitants of
the old days in the village of Yokelton, where Mr. Bumpkin
&ldquo;were bred and born&rsquo;d.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile the &ldquo;head witness&rdquo; had returned to the
cheerful scene in the taproom, and sat leering out of the corners
of his eyes upon the Sergeant, as though he expected every moment
that officer would make a spring at him and have him upon the
floor.&nbsp; But the Sergeant was not a bullying, blustering sort
of man at all; his demeanour was quiet in the extreme.&nbsp; He
scarcely looked at anyone.&nbsp; Simply engaged in warming his
hands at the cheerful fire, no one had cause to apprehend
anything from him.</p>
<p>But a man, Sergeant or no Sergeant, must, out of common
civility, exchange a word now and then, if only about the
weather; and so he said, carelessly,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sharp weather, lads!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, not even Joe could disagree with this; it was true, and
was assented to by all; Joe silently acquiescing.&nbsp; After the
Sergeant had warmed his hands and <!-- page 172--><a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>rubbed them
sufficiently, he took off his cap and placed it on a little shelf
or rack; and then took out a meerschaum pipe, which he exhibited
without appearing to do so to the whole company.&nbsp; Then he
filled it from his pouch, and rang the bell; and when the buxom
young waitress appeared, he said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, I think I&rsquo;ll have a nice rump steak and
some onions, if you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said the maid.</p>
<p>Now I observed that two or three matters were noteworthy at
this point.&nbsp; First, Joe&rsquo;s mouth so watered that he
actually went to the fireplace and expectorated.&nbsp; Secondly,
he was utterly amazed at the familiar manner in which the
Sergeant was permitted to address this beautiful young person,
who seemed to be quite a lady of quality.&nbsp; Thirdly, he was
duly impressed and astounded with the luxurious appetite of this
Sergeant of Hussars!</p>
<p>Then the young woman came back and said,&mdash;&ldquo;Would
you like to have it in the parlour, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O no, my dear,&rdquo; said the Sergeant; &ldquo;I would
rather have it here.&nbsp; I hate being alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he said this, he slightly glanced at Dick
Devilmecare.&nbsp; Dick, flattering himself that the observation
was addressed particularly to him, observed that he also hated
being alone.</p>
<p>Then the Sergeant lighted his pipe; and I suppose there was
not one in the company who did not think that tobacco
particularly nice.</p>
<p>Next, the Sergeant rang again, and once more the pretty maid
appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucy,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;while my steak is getting
ready, I <!-- page 173--><a name="page173"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 173</span>think I&rsquo;ll have three of
whiskey hot, with a little lemon in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this there was an involuntary smacking of lips all round,
although no one was conscious he had exhibited any emotion.&nbsp;
The Sergeant was perfectly easy and indifferent to
everything.&nbsp; He smoked, looked at the fire, sipped his grog,
spread out his legs, folded his arms; then rose and turned his
back to the fire, everyone thinking how thoroughly he enjoyed
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That smells very nice, Sergeant,&rdquo; said Harry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s very good,&rdquo; said the Sergeant;
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s some I got down at Yokelton,
Somersetshire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Joe looked up; he hadn&rsquo;t been home for a week, and
began to feel some interest in the old place, and everything
belonging to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I comes from that ere place, Mr. Sergeant,&rdquo; said
he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, sir,&rdquo; said the Sergeant, in an off-hand
manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did thee buy un at a shop by the Pond, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; replied the Sergeant, pointing
with his pipe, &ldquo;to the right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The seame plaace,&rdquo; exclaimed Joe.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why my sister lives there sarvant wi that ooman as keeps
the shop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said Sergeant Goodtale; &ldquo;how very
curious!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Jack said, &ldquo;What a rum thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Bill said, &ldquo;That is a rum thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Harry said it was a strange coincidence.&nbsp; In short,
they all agreed that it was the most remarkable circumstance that
ever was.</p>
<h2><!-- page 175--><a name="page175"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 175</span>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">The subject continued.</p>
<p>As soon as the conversation on the remarkable circumstance
recorded in the last chapter had drifted into another subject no
less remarkable, and the Sergeant had finished his pipe, the
beautiful being appeared with the rump steak and onions, a snowy
white cloth having been previously spread at the end of one of
the tables.&nbsp; When all was ready, it looked as nice and
appetizing as could well be conceived.&nbsp; The most indifferent
man there seemed the Sergeant himself, who, instead of rushing to
the chair provided for him, walked as coolly up to the table as
though he were going into action.&nbsp; Then he took the knife,
and seeing it had not quite so sharp an edge as he liked, gave it
a touch or two on the stone hearth.</p>
<p>The smell of that tobacco from Yokelton had been sweet; so had
the perfume from the whiskey toddy and the lemon; but of all the
delicious and soul-refreshing odours that ever titilated human
nostrils, nothing surely could equal that which proceeded from
the rump steak and onions.&nbsp; The fragrance of new mown hay,
which Cowper has so beautifully mentioned, had palled on
Joe&rsquo;s senses; but when would the fragrance of that dish
pall on the hungry soul?</p>
<p>The Sergeant took no notice of the hungry looks of <!-- page
176--><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
176</span>the company; he was a soldier, and concentrated his
mind upon the duties of the moment.&nbsp; Sentimentality was no
part of his nature.&nbsp; He was a man, and must eat; he was a
soldier, and must perform the work as a duty irrespective of
consequences.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mind my smoke?&rdquo; asked Harry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear, no,&rdquo; said the Sergeant; &ldquo;I like
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe stared and watched every bit as the Sergeant cut it.&nbsp;
He looked admiringly on the soldier and so lovingly at the steak,
that it almost seemed as if he wished he could be cut into such
delicious morsels and eaten by so happy a man.&nbsp; What
thoughts passed through his mind no one but a dreamer could tell;
and this is what I saw passing through the mind of Wurzel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, what a life! what grub! what jollyness! no turmut
oeing; no dung-cart; no edgin and ditchin; no five o&rsquo;clock
in the mornin; no master; no bein sweared at; no up afore the
magistrates; no ungriness; rump steaks and inguns; whiskey and
water and bacca; if I didn&rsquo;t like that air Polly Sweetlove,
danged if I wouldn&rsquo;t go for a soger to-morrer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then said Joe, very deferentially and as if he were afraid of
being up afore the magistrate, &ldquo;If you please, sir, med I
have a bit o&rsquo; that there bacca?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said the Sergeant, tossing his pouch;
&ldquo;certainly; help yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe&rsquo;s heart was softened more and more towards the
military, which he had hitherto regarded, from all he could hear,
as a devil&rsquo;s own trap to catch Sabbath breakers and
disobedient to parents.</p>
<p>And methought, in my dream, I never saw men who were not
partakers of a feast enjoy it more than the onlookers of that
military repast.</p>
<p><!-- page 177--><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>Then said Harry,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Sergeant, I&rsquo;m well-nigh tired of my life,
and I&rsquo;ve come here to enlist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just wait a bit,&rdquo; said the Sergeant;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a man to do things in a hurry.&nbsp; I never
allow a man to enlist, if I know it, in Her Majesty&rsquo;s
service, honourable and jolly as it is, without asking him to
think about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear, hear!&rdquo; said Lazyman; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
good, I likes that; don&rsquo;t be in a hurry, lad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear, hear!&rdquo; says Outofwork, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
jump into a job too soon, yer medn&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear, hear!&rdquo; says the Boardman, &ldquo;walk round
a-bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Harry, &ldquo;I have considered
it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve just had education enough to prevent my
getting a living, and not enough to make a man of me: I&rsquo;ve
tried everything and nobody wants me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Sergeant Goodtale, &ldquo;do you
think the Queen only wants them that nobody else&rsquo;ll
have.&nbsp; I can tell you that ain&rsquo;t the Queen of
England&rsquo;s way.&nbsp; It might do for Rooshia or Germany, or
them countries, but not for Old England.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a free
country.&nbsp; I think, lads, I&rsquo;m right&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here there was tremendous hammering on the table by way of
assent and applause; amidst which Joe could be observed thumping
his hard fist with as much vehemence as if he had got a County
Magistrate&rsquo;s head under it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a free country, sir,&rdquo; said the Sergeant,
&ldquo;no man here is kidnapped into the Army, which is a
profession for men, not slaves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to join,&rdquo; said Harry, &ldquo;say
what you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 178--><a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>&ldquo;Wait till the morning;&rdquo; said the Sergeant,
&ldquo;and meanwhile we&rsquo;ll have a song.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment Mr. Bumpkin put in an appearance; for although
he had been enjoying himself with Mr. and Mrs. Oldtimes, he
thought it prudent to have a peep and see how &ldquo;thic Joe wur
gettin on.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 179--><a name="page179"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 179</span>CHAPTER XX.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Mr. Bumpkin sings a good old song&mdash;the
Sergeant becomes quite a convivial companion and plays
dominoes.</p>
<p>The Sergeant, having finished his repast, again had recourse
to his pipe, and was proceeding to light it when Mr. Bumpkin
appeared in the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We be gwine to have a song, maister,&rdquo; said
Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give us a song, governor,&rdquo; said half-a-dozen
voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, do, maister,&rdquo; says Joe; &ldquo;thee sings a
good un, I knows, for I ha eerd thee often enough at arvest
oames: gie us a song, maister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now if there was one thing Mr. Bumpkin thought he was really
great at besides ploughing the straightest and levellest furrow,
it was singing the longest and levellest song.&nbsp; He had been
known to sing one, which, with its choruses, had lasted a full
half hour, and then had broken down for lack of memory.</p>
<p>On the present occasion he would have exhibited no reluctance,
having had a glass or two in the Bar Parlour had he not possessed
those misgivings about the Sergeant.&nbsp; He looked furtively at
that officer as though it were better to give him no
chance.&nbsp; Seeing, however, that he was smoking quietly, and
almost in a forlorn manner by himself, his apprehensions became
less oppressive.</p>
<p><!-- page 180--><a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
180</span>Invitations were repeated again and again, and with
such friendly vehemence that resistance at last was out of the
question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I aint sung for a good while,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;but I wunt be disagreeable like, so here goes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But before he could start there was such a thundering on the
tables that several minutes elapsed.&nbsp; At length there was
sufficient silence to enable him to be heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Church and Crown, lads.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Gie me the man as loves the Squire,<br
/>
The Parson, and the Beak;<br />
And labours twelve good hours a day<br />

<p>&ldquo;Hooroar! hooroar! hooroar!&rdquo; shouted
Lazyman.&nbsp; &ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye think &rsquo;o
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, my eye,&rdquo; said Outofwork, &ldquo;aint it
jolly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well done! bravo!&rdquo; shrieked the Boardman.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll carry that ere man through the streets on my
shoulders instead o&rsquo; the boards, that I will.&nbsp; Bravo!
he ought to be advertized&mdash;this style thirteen bob a

<p>&ldquo;Thirteen bob a week!&rdquo; laughed Harry;
&ldquo;who&rsquo;d go for a soldier with such a prospect.&nbsp;
Can you give us a job, governor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a bit, lads,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumpkin, &ldquo;there
be another werse and then a chorus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; they shouted, &ldquo;a chorus!
let&rsquo;s have the chorus&mdash;there ought to be a
chorus&mdash;thirteen bob a week!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, gentlemen, the chorus if you please,&rdquo; said
Harry; &ldquo;give it mouth, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then sang Bumpkin&mdash;</p>

<p style="text-align: center" class="poetry"><span
class="smcap">Chorus</span>.</p>
<p>At the termination of this pastoral song there was such a
hullabaloo of laughter, such a yelling, thumping, and, I grieve
to say, swearing, that Mr. Bumpkin wondered what on earth was the
occasion of it.&nbsp; At the Rent dinner at the Squire&rsquo;s he
had always sung it with great success; and the Squire himself had
done him the honour to say it was the best song he had ever
heard, while the Clergyman had assured him that the sentiments
were so good that it ought to be played upon the organ when the
people were coming out of church.&nbsp; And Farmer Grinddown, who
was the largest gentleman farmer for miles around, had declared
that if men would only act up to that it would be a happy
country, and we should soon be able to defy America itself.</p>
<p>Mr. Bumpkin, hearing such shouts of laughter, thought perhaps
he might have a patch of black on his face, and put his hand up
to feel.&nbsp; Then he looked about him to see if his dress was
disarranged; but finding nothing amiss, he candidly told them he
&ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t zee what there wur to laugh at thic
fashion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all said it was a capital song, and wondered if he had
any more of the same sort, and hoped he&rsquo;d leave them a lock
of his hair&mdash;and otherwise manifested tokens of enthusiastic
approbation.</p>
<p>Mr. Bumpkin, however, could not quite see their <!-- page
183--><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>mirth in the same light, so he turned on his heel and,
beckoning to Joe, left the room in high dudgeon, not to say
disdain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind Joe&mdash;no truck wi un.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, maister, he knows my sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn thee sister, Joe; it be a lie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be it? here&rsquo;s some o&rsquo; the bacca he brought
up from Okleton, I tell ee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell thee, have nowt to do wi un; we shall be on
t&rsquo;morrer, we be tenth in the list.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Joe, &ldquo;we bin igher in list un
thic, we bin as near as eight; I shall be mighty glad when it be
over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An get back to pigs, aye, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, maister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothin like oame, Joe, be there?&rdquo; and Mr. Bumpkin
turned away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Joe; &ldquo;no, maister, if so
be&rdquo; (and this was spoken to himself) &ldquo;if so be you
got a oame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I saw that Joe rejoined his companions, amongst whom a
conversation was going on as to the merits of the song.&nbsp;
Some said one thing and some another, but all condemned it as a
regular toading to the Parson and the Squire: and as for the
Beak, how any man could praise him whose only duty was to punish
the common people, no one could see.&nbsp; The company were
getting very comfortable.&nbsp; The Sergeant had called for
another glass of that delectable grog whose very perfume seemed
to inspire everyone with goodfellowship, and they all appeared to
enjoy the Sergeant&rsquo;s liquor without tasting it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say to a game of dominoes?&rdquo; said
Harry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t allow em ere,&rdquo; said Lazyman.</p>
<p><!-- page 184--><a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
184</span>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t they,&rdquo; answered
Outofwork.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll warrant if the Sergeant likes
to play there&rsquo;s no landlord&rsquo;ll stop him, ay,
Sergeant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I believe,&rdquo; said the Sergeant, &ldquo;as
one of the Queen&rsquo;s servants, I have the privilege of
playing when I like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Harry, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll be a
Queen&rsquo;s man too, so out with the shilling,
Sergeant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till the morning,&rdquo; said the Sergeant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Harry.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had
enough waiting.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m on, give me the
shilling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Sergeant said, &ldquo;Well, let me see, what height are
you?&rdquo; and he stood up beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I think I can get you
in,&rdquo; saying which he gave him a shilling; such a bright
coin, that it seemed to have come fresh from the Queen&rsquo;s
hand.</p>
<p>Then the Sergeant took out some beautiful bright ribbons which
he was understood to say (but did <i>not</i> say) the Queen had
given him that morning.&nbsp; Then he rang the bell, and the
buxom waitress appearing he asked for the favour of a needle and
thread, which, the radiant damsel producing, with her own fair
fingers she sewed the ribbons on to Harry&rsquo;s cap, smiling
with admiration all the while.&nbsp; Even this little incident
was not without its effect on the observant &ldquo;head
witness,&rdquo; and he felt an unaccountable fascination to have
the same office performed by the same fair hands on his own
hat.</p>
<p>Then, without saying more, a box of dominoes was produced, and
Joe soon found himself, he did not know how, the Sergeant&rsquo;s
partner, while Lazyman and Outofwork were opposed to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it pooty good livin in your trade, Mr.
Sergeant?&rdquo; asked Joe.</p>
<p><!-- page 185--><a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>&ldquo;Not bad,&rdquo; said the Sergeant; &ldquo;that
is five-one, I think&rdquo;&mdash;referring to the play.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rump steaks and ingons aint bad living,&rdquo; said
Outofwork.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Sergeant, &ldquo;and there&rsquo;s
nothing I like better than a good thick mutton chop for
breakfast&mdash;let me see, what&rsquo;s the game?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Joe, smacking his lips, &ldquo;mutton
chops is the best thing out; I aint had one in my mouth, though,
for a doocid long time; I likes em with plenty o&rsquo; fat an
gravy loike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said the Sergeant, &ldquo;when
you&rsquo;ve been out for a two or three mile ride before
breakfast in the fresh country air, a chap wants something good
for breakfast, and a mutton chop&rsquo;s none too much for
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Joe, &ldquo;I could tackle
three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Sergeant Goodtale, &ldquo;but some are
much larger than others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So em be,&rdquo; agreed Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the game,&rdquo; enquired the
Sergeant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two-one,&rdquo; said Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; said the soldier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell ee what,&rdquo; remarked Joe, &ldquo;if I was
going to list, there&rsquo;s no man as I&rsquo;d liefer list wi
than you, Mr. Sergeant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Domino!&rdquo; said the Sergeant, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
one to us, partner!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they shuffled the dominoes and commenced again.&nbsp; But
at this moment the full figure of Mr. Bumpkin again stood in the
doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe!&rdquo; he exclaimed angrily, &ldquo;I want thee,
come ere thirecly, I tell ee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, maister; I be comin.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 186--><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>&ldquo;You stoopid fool!&rdquo; said Mr. Bumpkin in a
whisper, as Joe went up to him, &ldquo;thee be playin with thic
feller.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, maister, if I be; what then?&rdquo; Joe said this
somewhat angrily, and Mr. Bumpkin replied:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll ha thee, Joe&mdash;he&rsquo;ll ha
thee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, nay, maister; I be too old in the tooth for he;
but it beant thy business, maister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Bumpkin, as he turned away, &ldquo;it
beant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Joe resumed his play.&nbsp; Now it happened that as the
Sergeant smacked his lips when he took his occasional sip of the
fragrant grog, expressive of the highest relish, it awakened a
great curiosity in Wurzel&rsquo;s mind as to its particular
flavour.&nbsp; The glass was never far from his nose and he had
long enjoyed the extremely tempting odour.&nbsp; At last, as he
was not invited to drink by Sergeant Goodtale, he could contain
himself no longer, but made so bold as to say:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardner, med I jist taste this ere?&nbsp; I never did
taste sich a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, partner,&rdquo; said the Sergeant, pushing
the tumbler, which was about three-parts full.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the game now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten-one,&rdquo; said Outofwork.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One&rsquo;s all, then,&rdquo; said the Sergeant.</p>
<p>Joe took the tumbler, and after looking into it for a second
or two as though he were mentally apostrophizing it, placed the
glass to his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid,&rdquo; said the Sergeant.</p>
<p>No one seemed more courageous than Wurzel, in respect of the
act with which he was engaged, and before he took the glass from
his lips its contents had disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m mighty glad thee spoke, Maister Sergeant, for
if <!-- page 187--><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>thee hadn&rsquo;t I should a drunk un all wirout thy
leave.&nbsp; I never tasted sich tackle in my life; it&rsquo;s
enough to make a man gie up everything for sogering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Domino!&rdquo; said the Sergeant.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think
that&rsquo;s the game!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;you have been
talking again in your sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I hope I have not
compromised myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not understand you,&rdquo; cried she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more do I, for I am hardly awake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been talking of Joe Wurzel again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, to be sure.&nbsp; What about him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you mentioned Mr. Outofwork and Mr. Lazyman and
Mr. Devilmecare, and another whose name I did not
catch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;did they go for
soldiers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At present, no, except Harry, for whom I was heartily
sorry, he seemed such a nice disappointed lad.&nbsp; But pray who
is this Sergeant Goodtale?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is on recruiting service, a very fine, persuasive
fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he didn&rsquo;t seem to press these people or use
any arts to entice them: I like him for that.&nbsp; He rather
seemed to me to discourage them from enlisting.&nbsp; He might
have been sure poor Harry meant it, because, as I take it, he was
half-starved, and yet he desired him to wait till the
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;his conduct was artful
if you examine it with reference to its effect on the others; but
he is an extraordinary man, this Sergeant Goodtale&mdash;was
never known to persuade any one to enlist, I believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 188--><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>&ldquo;But he seemed to get along very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very; I thought he got along very
comfortably.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there was one Lucy Prettyface!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I don&rsquo;t remember her,&rdquo; cried I, alarmed
lest I might have said anything in my dream for which I was not
responsible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why she was the girl who sewed the colours on and
somebody called &lsquo;my dear.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I assure you,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;it was not I: it
must have been the Sergeant; but I have no recollection&mdash;O
yes, to be sure, she was the waitress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember her now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, determined not to yield if I could
possibly help it, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say that I do.&nbsp; I
know there was a person who sewed colours on and whom the
Sergeant called &lsquo;my dear,&rsquo; but further than that I
should not like to pledge myself.&nbsp; Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;to be
sure,&rdquo; and here I went on talking, as it were, to myself,
for I find it is much better to talk to yourself if you find it
difficult to carry on a conversation with other persons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was pretty, wasn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; said my wife
with an arch look.</p>
<p>I gave her a look just as arch, as I replied,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really I hardly looked at her; but I should say
<i>not</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; I make a point of never saying any one
is pretty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe thought her so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he?&nbsp; Well she may have been, but I never went
in for Beauty myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shocking man,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;do you
perceive what you are saying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course; but you take me up so sharply: if you
had not cut me off in the flower of my speech you would have been
gratified at the finish of my sentence.&nbsp; <!-- page 189--><a
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>I was going
to say, I never went in for Beauty, but once.&nbsp; That, I
think, gives the sentence a pretty turn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, I think these dreams and this talking in
your sleep indicate that you require a change; what do you say to
Bournemouth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think I shall sleep better there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it will do you good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll go to Bournemouth,&rdquo; cried I,
&ldquo;for I understand it&rsquo;s a very dreamy
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I should like to know what becomes of this action
of Mr. Bumpkin, and how all his people get on?&nbsp; You may
depend upon it that Sergeant will enlist those other
men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; I remarked, &ldquo;what is in the
future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But surely you know what you intend.&nbsp; You can make
your characters do anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed not,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;They will have
their own way whether I write their history or any one
else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That Sergeant Goodtale will have every one of them, my
dear; you mark my words.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s the most artful man I
ever heard of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course I could offer no contradiction to this statement as
I was not in the secrets of the future.&nbsp; How the matter will
work out depends upon a variety of circumstances over which I
have not the least control.&nbsp; For instance, if Bill were to
take the shilling, I believe Dick would follow: and if the
Sergeant were to sing a good song he might catch the rest.&nbsp;
But who can tell?</p>

<p class="gutsumm">Joe electrifies the company and surprises the

<p>&ldquo;Suppose we have another song,&rdquo; said Sergeant
Goodtale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And spoase we has some moore o&rsquo; that there

<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said Harry, &ldquo;we will too.&nbsp;

<p>Saying which he rang the bell and ordered a glass for himself

class="pagenum">p. 195</span>I sees the error o&rsquo; my
ways,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So, lads, this warnin&rsquo; take,<br />
The Poor Man&rsquo;s path, the parson says,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Winds round the Burnin&rsquo; Lake.</p>
<p class="poetry">They&rsquo;ve changed it since the days
o&rsquo; yore,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Them Gospel preachers, drat un;<br />
They used to preach it to the poor,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; An&rsquo; now they preach it <i>at</i> un.</p>
<p>Every one was amazed at the astonishing memory of this country
lad: and the applause that greeted the reciter might well be
calculated to awaken his latent vanity.&nbsp; It was like being
called before the curtain after the first act by a young actor on
his first appearance.&nbsp; And I believe every one understood
the meaning of the verses, which seemed to imply that the hungry
prodigal, famishing for food, was fed with husks instead of
grain.&nbsp; Contentment with wretchedness is not good preaching,
and this was one lesson of Dr. Brimstone&rsquo;s sermon.&nbsp; As
soon as Harry could make himself heard amidst the general hubbub,
which usually follows a great performance, he said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, look here, lads, it&rsquo;s all very well to be
converted with such preaching as that; but it&rsquo;s my belie
it&rsquo;s more calculated to make hypocrites than
Christians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear! hear!&rdquo; said Lazyman.&nbsp; &ldquo;That
<i>is</i> right.&rdquo;&nbsp; Anything but conversion for
Lazyman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; continued Harry, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard
that kind of preaching a hundred times: it&rsquo;s a regular
old-fashioned country sermon; and, as for the poor being so near
hell, I put it in these four lines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear, hear!&rdquo; cried the company;
&ldquo;order!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they prepared themselves for what was to come with as
great eagerness as, I venture to say, would <!-- page 196--><a
name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>always be
shown to catch the text, if it came at the end, instead of the
beginning, of a sermon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up,&rdquo; says Lazyman; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s
&rsquo;ear this &rsquo;ere.&nbsp; I knows it&rsquo;s summut good
by the look an him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make a row,&rdquo; retorts the Boardman;
&ldquo;who can hear anything while you keeps on like
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And there they stood, actually suspending the operation of
smoking as they waited the summing up of this remarkably orthodox
&ldquo;preaching of the word.&rdquo;&nbsp; The sergeant only was
a spectator of the scene, and much amused did he seem at the
faces that prepared for a grin or a sneer as the forthcoming
utterance should demand.&nbsp; Then said Harry solemnly and
dramatically:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In <span class="smcap">Want</span> full
many a vice is born,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Virtue in a <span
class="smcap">Dinner</span>;<br />
A well-spread board makes many a <span
class="smcap">Saint</span>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And <span class="smcap">Hunger</span> many a
sinner.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the explosion which followed this antidote to Mr.
Brimstone&rsquo;s sermon, I should judge that the more part of
the company believed that Poverty was almost as ample a virtue as
Charity itself.&nbsp; They shook their heads in token of assent;
they thumped the table in recognition of the soundness of the
teaching; and several uttered an exclamation not to be committed
to paper, as an earnest of their admiration for the ability of
Mr. Highlow, who, instead of being a private soldier, ought, in
their judgment, to be Lord Mayor of London.&nbsp; After this
recital every one said he thought Mr. Highlow might oblige
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m no singer,&rdquo; said Harry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try, Harry!&rdquo; exclaimed Lazyman: he was a rare one
to advise other people to try.</p>
<p><!-- page 197--><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
197</span>&ldquo;Trying to sing when you can&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
answered Harry, &ldquo;I should think is a rum sort of business;
but I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll do if you like.&nbsp;
When I was down at Hearne Bay I heard an old fisherman tell a
story which&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; thumped out Joe, &ldquo;a
story.&nbsp; I likes a good story, specially if there be a goast
in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what there is in it,&rdquo; said
Harry, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave you to make that out; but I tell
you what I did when I heard it, I made a ballad of it, and so if
you like I&rsquo;ll try and recollect it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; they said, and Harry gave them the
following</p>
<h3>SONG OF THE WAVES.</h3>
<p class="poetry">Far away on the pebbly beach<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That echoes the sound of the surge;<br />
As if they were gifted with speech,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The breakers will sing you a dirge.</p>
<p class="poetry">The fishermen list to it oft,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And love the sweet charm of its spell,<br />
For sometimes it wispers so soft,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems but the voice of the shell.</p>
<p class="poetry">It tells of a beautiful child<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That used to come down there and play,<br />
And shout to the surges so wild<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That burst on the brink of the bay.</p>
<p class="poetry">She was but a child of the poor,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose father had perished at sea;<br />
&rsquo;Twas strange, that sweet psalm of the shore,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever the story might be!</p>
<p class="poetry">Yes, strange, but so true in its tone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That no one could listen and doubt;<br />
The heart must be calm and alone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To search its deep mystery out.</p>
<p class="poetry"><!-- page 198--><a name="page198"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 198</span>She came with a smaller than she<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; That toddled along at her side;<br />
Now ran to and fled from the sea,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Now paddled its feet in the tide.</p>
<p class="poetry">Afar o&rsquo;er the waters so wild,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Grazed Effie with wondering eye;<br />
What mystery grew on the child<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In all that bright circle of sky?</p>
<p class="poetry">Her father&mdash;how sweet was the thought!<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was linked with this childish delight;<br />
&rsquo;Twas strange what a vision it brought&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As though he still lingered in sight.</p>
<p class="poetry">Was it Heaven so near, so remote,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Across the blue line of the wave?<br />
&rsquo;Twas thither he sailed in his boat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas there he went down in his grave!</p>
<p class="poetry">So the days and the hours flew along,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like swallows that skim o&rsquo;er the flood;<br />
Like the sound of a beautiful song,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That echoes and dies in the wood!</p>
<p class="poetry">One day as they strayed on the strand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And played with the shingle and shell,<br />
A boat that just touched on the land<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was playfully rocked by the swell.</p>
<p class="poetry">O childhood, what joy in a ride!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What eagerness beams in their eyes!<br />
What bliss as they climb o&rsquo;er the side<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And shout as they tumble and rise!</p>
<p class="poetry">O sea, with thy pitiful dirge,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou need&rsquo;st to be mournful and moan!<br />
The wrath of thy terrible surge<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Omnipotence curbs it alone!</p>
<p class="poetry">The boat bore away from the shore,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The laughter of childhood so glad!<br />
And the breakers bring back ever more<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The dirge with its echo so sad!</p>
<p class="poetry"><!-- page 199--><a name="page199"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 199</span>A widow sits mute on the beach,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And ever the tides as they flow,<br />
As if they were gifted with speech,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Repeat the sad tale of her woe!</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s werry good,&rdquo; said the
Boardman.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid them there children was
washed away&mdash;it&rsquo;s a terrible dangerous coast that ere
Ern Bay.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve &rsquo;eeard my father speak on
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them there werses is rippin&rsquo;!&rdquo; said
Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stunnin&rsquo;!&rdquo; exclaimed Bob.</p>
<p>And so they all agreed that it was a pretty song and
&ldquo;well put together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Capital,&rdquo; said the sergeant, &ldquo;I never heard
anything better, and as for Mr. Wurzel, a man with his memory
ought to do something better than feed pigs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, aye,&rdquo; said the company to a man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you follow my example?&rdquo; said
Harry; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the finest life in the world for a young
fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the sergeant, &ldquo;that all
depends; its very good for some, for others not so
good&mdash;although there are very few who are not pleased when
they once join, especially in such a regiment as ours!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And would you mind telling me, sir,&rdquo; asked
Outofwork, &ldquo;what sort of chaps it don&rsquo;t
suit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, chaps that have been brought up in the
country and tied to their mothers&rsquo; apron strings all their
life: they have such soft hearts, they are almost sure to
cry&mdash;and a crying soldier is a poor affair.&nbsp; I
wouldn&rsquo;t enlist a chap of that sort, no, not if he gave me
ten pounds.&nbsp; Now, for instance, if Mr. Wurzel was to ask my
advice about being a soldier I should say
&lsquo;don&rsquo;t!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 200--><a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
200</span>&ldquo;Why not, sir?&rdquo; asked Joe;
&ldquo;how&rsquo;s that there, then?&nbsp; D&rsquo;ye think I be
afeard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say, go home first, my boy, and ask your
mother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I be d---d if I be sich a molly-coddle as that, nuther;
and I&rsquo;ll prove un, Mr. Sergeant; gie me thic bright
shillin&rsquo; and I be your man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the sergeant, &ldquo;think it over, and
come to me in a month&rsquo;s time, if your mother will let
you.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want men that will let their masters buy
them off the next day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; an lookee here, Maister Sergeant; I bean&rsquo;t to
be bought off like thic, nuther.&nbsp; If I goes, I goes for good
an&rsquo; all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said the sergeant, shaking him by
the hand, and pressing into it the bright shilling, &ldquo;if you
insist on joining, you shall not say I prevented you: my business
is not to prevent men from entering Her Majesty&rsquo;s
service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the ribbons were brought out, and Joe asked if the young
woman might sew them on as she had done Harry&rsquo;s; and when
she came in, Joe looked at her, and tried to put on a military
bearing, in imitation of his great prototype; and actually went
so far as to address her as &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; for which
liberty he almost expected a slap in the face.&nbsp; But Lucy
only smiled graciously, and said: &ldquo;Bravo, Mr. Wurzel!&nbsp;
Bravo, sir; I&rsquo;ve seen many a man inlisted, and sewed the
Queen&rsquo;s colours on for him, but never for a smarter or a
finer fellow, there!&rdquo; and she skipped from the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well done!&rdquo; said several voices.&nbsp; And the
sergeant said:</p>
<p><!-- page 201--><a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
201</span>&ldquo;What do you think of that, Mr. Wurzel?&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll back she&rsquo;s never said that to a soldier
before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe turned his hat about and drew the ribbons through his
fingers, as pleased as a child with a new toy, and as proud as if
he had helped to win a great battle.</p>
<p>Here I awoke.</p>
<h2><!-- page 203--><a name="page203"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 203</span>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">The Sergeant makes a loyal speech and sings a
song, both of which are well received by the company.</p>
<p>And when I got to Bournemouth I dreamed again; and a singular
thing during this history was, that always in my dream I began
where I had left off on the previous night.&nbsp; So I saw that
there, in the room at &ldquo;The Goose,&rdquo; were Sergeant
Goodtale, and Harry, and Joe, and the rest, just as I had left
them when I last awoke.&nbsp; But methought there was an air of
swagger on the part of the head witness which I had not observed
previously.&nbsp; His hat was placed on one side, in imitation of
the sergeant&rsquo;s natty cap, and he seemed already to hold up
his head in a highly military manner; and when he stooped down to
get a light he tried to stoop in the same graceful and military
style as the sergeant himself; and after blowing it out, threw
down the spill in the most off-hand manner possible, as though he
said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s how we chaps do it in the
Hussars!&rdquo;&nbsp; Everyone noticed the difference in the
manner and bearing of the young recruit.&nbsp; There was a
certain swagger and boldness of demeanour that only comes after
you have enlisted.&nbsp; Nor was this change confined to outward
appearance alone.&nbsp; What now were pigs in the mind of
Joe?&nbsp; Merely the producers of pork chops for <!-- page
204--><a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>breakfast.&nbsp; What was Dobbin that slowly dragged
the plough compared to the charger that Joe was destined to
bestride?&nbsp; And what about Polly Sweetlove and her saucy
looks?&nbsp; Perhaps she&rsquo;d be rather sorry now that she did
not receive with more favour his many attentions.&nbsp; Such were
the thoughts that passed through the lad&rsquo;s mind as he
gradually awakened to a sense of his new position.&nbsp; One
thought, however, strange to say, did not occur to him, and that
was as to what his poor old mother would think.&nbsp; Dutiful son
as Joe had always been, (though wild in some respects), he had
not given her a single thought.&nbsp; But his reflections, no
doubt, were transient and confused amid the companions by whom he
was surrounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll make a fine soldier,&rdquo; said the
Boardman, as he saw him swagger across to his seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the sergeant, &ldquo;any man that has
got it in him, and is steady, and doesn&rsquo;t eat too much and
drink too much, may get on in the army.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t like
it used to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe that,&rdquo; said Bob Lazyman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only thing,&rdquo; continued the sergeant,
&ldquo;is, there is really so little to do&mdash;there&rsquo;s
not work enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ud suit me,&rdquo; said Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! but stop,&rdquo; added the sergeant, &ldquo;the
temptations are great&mdash;what with the
girls&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; exclaimed Dick; &ldquo;that beats
all&mdash;I likes them better than mutton chops.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the sergeant; &ldquo;they are all
very well in their way; but you know, if a man wants to rise in
the army, he must be steady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steady, boys! stea&mdash;dy!&rdquo; shouted Dick</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how far the sergeant was justified, <!--
page 205--><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
205</span>morally, in thus holding out the prospect of riotous
living to these hungry men, but I think, all things considered,
it was an improvement on the old system of the pressgang, which
forced men into the navy.&nbsp; These lads were not bound to
believe the recruiting sergeant, and were not obliged to enter
into a contract with Her Majesty.&nbsp; At the same time, the
alluring prospects were such that if they had been represented as
facts in the commercial transactions of life, such is the purity
of the law that they would have given rise to much pleading,
multifarious points reserved, innumerable summonses at Chambers,
and, at least, one new trial.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Jack Outofwork, &ldquo;I tell yer what
it is&mdash;I don&rsquo;t take no Queen&rsquo;s shilling, for
why? it ain&rsquo;t the Queen&rsquo;s&mdash;it belongs to the
people&mdash;I&rsquo;m for a republic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the sergeant, &ldquo;I always
like to meet a chap that calls himself a republican, and
I&rsquo;ll tell you why.&nbsp; This country is a republic, say
what you like, and is presided over by our gracious Queen.&nbsp;
And I should like to ask any man in this country&mdash;now, just
listen, lads, for this is the real question,
whether&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, order,&rdquo; said Lazyman, &ldquo;I never
&rsquo;eerd nothing put better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have order, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Harry;
&ldquo;chair! chair!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All &rsquo;tention, sergeant,&rdquo; said Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; continued the sergeant; &ldquo;let us
suppose we got a republic to-morrow; well, we should want a head,
or as they say, a president.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; said half-a-dozen voices.</p>
<p><!-- page 206--><a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
206</span>&ldquo;Well, what then?&rdquo; said the sergeant;
&ldquo;Who would you choose?&nbsp; Why, the Queen, to be
sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everybody said &ldquo;The Queen!&rdquo;&nbsp; And there was
such a thumping on the table that all further discourse was
prevented for several minutes.&nbsp; At last everyone said it was
good, and the sergeant had put it straight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, look&rsquo;ee &rsquo;ere, lads&mdash;I was born
among the poor and I don&rsquo;t owe nothing to the upper
classes, not even a grudge!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear! hear!&nbsp; Bravo, Mr. Sergeant!&rdquo; cried
all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then; I&rsquo;ve got on so far as well as I can,
and I&rsquo;m satisfied; but I&rsquo;ll tell you what I believe
our Queen to be&mdash;a thorough woman, and loves her people,
especially the poor, so much that d---d if I wouldn&rsquo;t die
for her any day&mdash;now what d&rsquo;ye think o&rsquo;
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everybody thought he was a capital fellow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, here,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t
because she wears a gold crown, or anything of that sort, nor
because a word of her&rsquo;s could make me a field marshal, or a
duke, or anything o&rsquo; that sort, nor because she&rsquo;s
rich, but I&rsquo;ll tell you why it is&mdash;and it&rsquo;s
this&mdash;when we&rsquo;re fighting we don&rsquo;t fight for her
except as the Queen, and the Queen means the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear! hear! hear! hear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we fight for the country&mdash;but she loves the
soldiers as though they were not the country&rsquo;s but her own
flesh and blood, and comes to see &rsquo;em in the hospital like
a mother, and talks to &rsquo;em the same as I do to you, and
comforts &rsquo;em, and prays for &rsquo;em, and acts like the
real mother of her people&mdash;that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;d die
for her, and not because she&rsquo;s the Queen of England
only.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 207--><a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span>&ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; said Joe.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hope I
shall soon see her in th&rsquo; &rsquo;orsepittal.&nbsp; It be
out &rsquo;ere: beant it St. Thomas&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you won&rsquo;t, my brave lad,&rdquo; said the
sergeant; &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t tell me about republicanism when
we&rsquo;ve got such a good Queen; it&rsquo;s a shame and a
disgrace to mention it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it be,&rdquo; said Joe; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m darned if I
wouldn&rsquo;t knock a feller into the middle o&rsquo; next week
as talked like thic.&nbsp; Hooroar for the Queen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now I&rsquo;m going to say another thing,&rdquo;
continued the sergeant, who really waxed warm with his subject,
and struck admiration into his audience by his manner of
delivery: may I say that to my mind he was even eloquent, and
ought to have been a sergeant-at-law, only that the country would
have been the loser by it: and the country, to my mind, has the
first right to the services of every citizen.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just
look,&rdquo; said the sergeant, &ldquo;at the kindness of
that&mdash;what shall I call her? blessed!&mdash;yes, blessed
Princess of Wales!&nbsp; Was there ever such a woman?&nbsp; Talk
about Jael in the Bible being blessed above women&mdash;why I
don&rsquo;t set no value upon her; she put a spike through a
feller it&rsquo;s true, but it was precious cowardly; but the
Princess, she goes here and goes there visiting the sick and poor
and homeless, not like a princess, but like a real woman, and
that&rsquo;s why the people love her.&nbsp; No man despises a
toady more than I do&mdash;I&rsquo;d give him up to the tender
mercies of that wife of Heber the Keenite any day; but if the
Princess was to say to me, &lsquo;Look &rsquo;ere, Sergeant, I
feel a little low, and should like some nice little excitement
just to keep up my spirits and cheer me up a bit&rsquo;&rdquo;
(several of them thought this style of conversation was a
familiar habit with the Princess and Sergeant Goodtale, and that
he <!-- page 208--><a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
208</span>must be immensely popular with the Royal Family),
&ldquo;well, if she was to say, &lsquo;Look here, Sergeant
Goodtale, here&rsquo;s a precipice, it ud do me good to see you
leap off that,&rsquo; I should just take off my coat and tuck up
my shirt sleeves, and away I should go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At such unheard of heroism and loyalty there was a general
exclamation of enthusiasm, and no one in that company could tell
whom he at that moment most admired, the Princess or the
Sergeant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a stunner!&rdquo; said Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Princess by name and Princess by nature,&rdquo; replied
the sergeant; &ldquo;and now look&rsquo;ee here, in proof of what
I say, I&rsquo;m going to give you a toast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear, hear,&rdquo; said everybody.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But stop a minute,&rdquo; said the sergeant,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a man of words without deeds.&nbsp; Have we
got anything to drink to the toast?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All looked in their respective cups and every one said,
&ldquo;No, not a drop!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then said the sergeant &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have one all rounded
for the last.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll find me as good as my
word.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s it to be before we part?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t beat this &rsquo;ere,&rdquo; said Joe,
looking into the sergeant&rsquo;s empty glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So say all of us,&rdquo; exclaimed Harry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; said all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a song from the sergeant,&rdquo; added
Devilmecare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, lads, I&rsquo;ll give you a song.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then came in the pretty maid whom Joe leered at, and the
sergeant winked at; and then came in tumblers of the military
beverage, and then the sergeant said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In all companies this is drunk upstanding, and with
<!-- page 209--><a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
209</span>hats off, except soldiers, whose privilege it is to
keep them on.&nbsp; You need not take yours off, Mr. Wurzel; you
are one of Her Majesty&rsquo;s Hussars.&nbsp; Now then all say
after me: &lsquo;Our gracious Queen; long may she live and
blessed be her reign&mdash;the mother and friend of her
people!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The enthusiasm was loud and general, and the toast was drunk
with as hearty a relish as ever it was at Lord Mayor&rsquo;s
Banquet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said the sergeant, &ldquo;once more
before we part&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! but the song?&rdquo; said the Boardman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I keep my word.&nbsp; A man, unless he&rsquo;s
a man of his word, ought never to wear Her Majesty&rsquo;s
uniform!&rdquo;&nbsp; And then he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Prince and Princess of Wales and the rest of the
Royal Family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This also was responded to in the same unequivocal manner; and
then amid calls of &ldquo;the sergeant,&rdquo; that officer,
after getting his voice in tune, sang the following song:</p>
<h3>GOD BLESS OUR DEAR PRINCESS.</h3>
<p class="poetry">There&rsquo;s not a grief the heart can bear<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; But love can soothe its pain;<br />
There&rsquo;s not a sorrow or a care<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It smiles upon in vain.<br />
And <i>She</i> sends forth its brightest rays<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where darkest woes depress,<br />
Where long wept Suffering silent prays&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; God save our dear Princess!</p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="poetry"><span
class="smcap">chorus</span>.</p>
<p class="poetry">She soothes the breaking heart,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She comforts in distress;<br />
She acts true woman&rsquo;s noblest part.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; God save our dear Princess<br />
<!-- page 210--><a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

&nbsp;&nbsp; So worn by hopeless toil;<br />
E&rsquo;en Sorrow&rsquo;s drooping form revives<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beneath her loving smile.<br />
Where helpless Age reluctant seeks<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Its refuge from distress,<br />
E&rsquo;en there <i>Her</i> name the prayer bespeaks<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; God save our dear Princess!</p>
<p class="poetry">It&rsquo;s not in rank or princely show<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; True <i>Manhood&rsquo;s</i> heart to win;<br />
&rsquo;Tis Love&rsquo;s sweet sympathetic glow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That makes all hearts akin.<br />
Though frequent storms the State must stir<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While Freedom we possess,<br />
Our hearts may all beat true to Her,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our own beloved Princess.</p>
<p class="poetry">The violet gives its sweet perfume<br />

May God her gentle life prolong<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And all her pathway bless;<br />
Be this the nation&rsquo;s fervent song&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; God save our dear Princess!</p>
<p>Although the language of a song may not always be intelligible
to the unlettered hearer, the spirit and sentiment are;
especially when it appeals to the emotions through the charms of
music.&nbsp; The sergeant had a musical voice capable of deep
pathos; and as the note of a bird or the cry of an animal in
distress is always distinguishable from every other sound, so the
pathos of poetry finds its way where its words are not always
accurately understood.&nbsp; It was very observable, and much I
thought to the sergeant&rsquo;s great power as a singer, that the
first chorus was sung with a tone which seemed to imply that the
audience was feeling its way: <!-- page 211--><a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>the second
was given with more enthusiasm and vehemence: the third was
thumped upon the table as though a drum were required to give
full effect to the feelings of the company; while the fourth was
shouted with such heartiness that mere singing seemed useless,
and it developed into loud hurrahs, repeated again and again; and
emphasized by the twirling of hats, the clapping of hands, and
stamping of feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye think o&rsquo; that?&rdquo; says the
Boardman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on,&rdquo; said Lazyman; &ldquo;give me the
shilling, sergeant, if you please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So&rsquo;m I,&rdquo; said Saunter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hooroar!&rdquo; shouted the stentorian voice that had
erstwhile charmed the audience with Brimstone&rsquo;s sermon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; said Harry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look&rsquo;ee here,&rdquo; said Jack Outofwork,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ve had a werry pleasant evenin&rsquo; together,
and I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to part like this &rsquo;ere; no
more walkin&rsquo; about looking arter jobs for me, I&rsquo;m
your man, sergeant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the sergeant, eyeing his company,
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect this; a pluckier lot o&rsquo; chaps
I never see; and I&rsquo;m sure when the Queen sees you
it&rsquo;ll be the proudest moment of her life.&nbsp; Why, how
tall do you stand, Mr. Lazyman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six foot one,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha,&rdquo; said the Sergeant, &ldquo;I thought
so.&nbsp; And you, Mr. Outofwork?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t rightly know,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the sergeant, &ldquo;just stand up by
the side of me&mdash;ha, that will do,&rdquo; he added,
pretending to take an accurate survey, &ldquo;I think I can
squeeze you in&mdash;it will be a tight fit though.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 212--><a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>&ldquo;I hope you can, Mr. Sergeant,&rdquo; said
he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look &rsquo;ere,&rdquo; laughed Joe; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
kitch &rsquo;old of his legs and give him a stretch, won&rsquo;t
us, Sergeant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so the bright shillings were given, and the pretty
maid&rsquo;s services were again called in; and she said
&ldquo;she never see sich a lot o&rsquo; plucky fellows in her
born days;&rdquo; and all were about to depart when, as the
sergeant was shaking hands with Dick Devilmecare in the most
pathetic and friendly manner, as though he were parting from a
brother whom he had not met for years, Devilmecare&rsquo;s eyes
filled with tears, and he exclaimed,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Danged if I&rsquo;ll be left out of it, sergeant; give
me the shillin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment the portly figure of Mr. Bumpkin again appeared
in the doorway!</p>
<h2><!-- page 213--><a name="page213"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 213</span>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">The famous Don O&rsquo;Rapley and Mr. Bumpkin
spend a social evening at the &ldquo;Goose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Mr. Bumpkin, on this memorable evening, went into Mrs.
Oldtimes&rsquo; parlour to console himself after the fatigues and
troubles of the day there were a cheerful fire and a comfortable
meal prepared for him.&nbsp; Mr. O&rsquo;Rapley had promised to
spend the evening with him, so that they might talk over the
business of the day and the prospects of the coming trial.&nbsp;
It was a very singular coincidence, and one that tended to cement
the friendship of these two gentlemen, that their tastes both
inclined to gin-and-water.&nbsp; And this very house, as appeared
from a notice on the outside, was the &ldquo;noted house for
Foolman&rsquo;s celebrated gin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But as yet Mr. O&rsquo;Rapley had not arrived; so after his
meal Mr. Bumpkin looked into the other room to see how Joe was
getting on, for he was extremely anxious to keep his &ldquo;head
witness&rdquo; straight.&nbsp; &ldquo;Joe was his
mainstay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have already related what took place, and the song that
Bumpkin sang.&nbsp; The statement of the head witness that he was
all right, and that he was up to Mr. Sergeant, to a great extent
reassured Mr. Bumpkin: although he felt, keen man that he was,
that that soldier was there for the purpose of &ldquo;ketchin
what <!-- page 214--><a name="page214"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 214</span>young men he could to make sogers on
&rsquo;em; he had &rsquo;eerd o&rsquo; sich things afore:&rdquo;
such were his thoughts as Mr. O&rsquo;Rapley entered the
apartment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me, Mr. Bumpkin,&rdquo; said that official,
&ldquo;how very cold it is! how are you, Mrs. Oldtimes?&nbsp; I
haven&rsquo;t seen you for an age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Don always made that observation when strangers were
present.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope you&rsquo;re quite well, sir,&rdquo; said the
landlady, with much humility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll thee please to take, sir?&rdquo; asked
Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, I daresay you&rsquo;ll think me remarkable
strange, Mr. Bumpkin, but I&rsquo;m going to say something which
I very very seldom indulge in, but it&rsquo;s good, I believe,
for indigestion.&nbsp; I will take a little&mdash;just a very
small quantity&mdash;of gin, with some hot water, and a large
lump of sugar, to destroy the alcohol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said the knowing Bumpkin;
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s wot we call gin-and-water in our part of the
country.&nbsp; So&rsquo;ll I, Mrs. Oldtimes, but not too much hot
water for I.&nbsp; What&rsquo;ll thee smoke, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, one of those cheroots that my lord praised
so much the last time we was &rsquo;ere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please, sir,&rdquo; said the landlady, with a
very good-natured smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the O&rsquo;Rapley, in his
patronizing manner; &ldquo;and how have we got on to-day? let us
hear all about it.&nbsp; Come, your good health, Mr. Bumkin, and
success to our lawsuit.&nbsp; I call it <i>ours</i> now, for I
really feel as interested in it as you do yourself; by-the-bye,
what&rsquo;s it all about, Mr. Bumpkin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, you see,&rdquo; replied the astute man,
&ldquo;I hardly knows; it beginnd about a pig, but what
it&rsquo;s <!-- page 215--><a name="page215"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 215</span>about now, be more un I can tell
thee.&nbsp; I think it be salt and trespass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have not enquired?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I beant; I left un all in the hands o&rsquo; my
lawyer, and I believe he&rsquo;s a goodun, bean&rsquo;t
he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see; O dear, yes, a capital man&mdash;a very
good man indeed, a close shaver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is ur? and that&rsquo;s what I want.&nbsp; I wants thic
feller shaved as close to his chin as may be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Rapley, &ldquo;and Prigg will
shave him, and no mistake.&nbsp; Well, and how did we get on at
the Mansion House?&nbsp; First of all, who was against
you?&mdash;Mrs. Oldtimes, I <i>think</i> I&rsquo;ll just take a
very small quantity more, it has quite removed my
indigestion&mdash;who was against you, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Nimble; but, lor, he worn&rsquo;t nowhere; I had un
to rights,&mdash;jest gi&rsquo;e me a leetle more,
missus,&mdash;he couldn&rsquo;t axe I a question I couldn&rsquo;t
answer; and I believe he said as good, for I zeed un talking to
the Lord Mayor; it worn&rsquo;t no use to question I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t say anything about me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Bumpkin, in a loud whisper;
&ldquo;I din&rsquo;t; but I did say afore I could stop the word
from comin&rsquo; out o&rsquo; my mouth as I had a
<i>companion</i>, but they didn&rsquo;t ketch it, except that the
gentleman under the lord mayor were gwine to ax about thee, and
blowed if the counsellor didn&rsquo;t stop un; so that be all
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Capital!&rdquo; exclaimed the great bowler, waving his
arm as if in the act of delivery; then, in a whisper, &ldquo;Did
they ask about the woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noa&mdash;they doan&rsquo;t know nowt about
thic&mdash;not a word; I was mighty plased at un, for although,
as thee be aware, it be the biggest lie as ever wur heard, I <!--
page 216--><a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
216</span>wouldn&rsquo;t have my wife hear o&rsquo; sich to save
my life.&nbsp; She be a good wife to I an&rsquo; allays have a
bin; but there I thee could clear me in a minute, if need be,
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but you see,&rdquo; said the artful Don, &ldquo;if
I was to appear, it would make a sensational case of it in a
minute and fill all the papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would ur now?&nbsp; Morn&rsquo;t do that nuther; but,
wot d&rsquo;ye think, sir?&nbsp; As I wur leavin&rsquo; the
Cooart, a gemman comes up and he says, says he, &lsquo;I spoase,
sir, you don&rsquo;t want this thing put in the
papers?&rsquo;&nbsp; How the dooce he knowed that, I can&rsquo;t
make out, onless that I wouldn&rsquo;t say where I lived, for the
sake o&rsquo; Nancy; no, nor thee couldn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo;
dragged un out o&rsquo; me wi&rsquo; horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; said the Don, interrogatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;no, I don&rsquo;t
partickler want it in.&rsquo;&nbsp; I thought I&rsquo;d say that,
don&rsquo;t thee zee (with a wink), &rsquo;cos he shouldn&rsquo;t
think I were eager like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this &rsquo;ere gemman says, says he, &lsquo;It
don&rsquo;t matter to me, sir, whether it&rsquo;s in or not, but
if thee don&rsquo;t want it in, I&rsquo;ll keep it out,
that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; It will pay I better p&rsquo;raps to put
un in.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And who med thee be, sir?&rsquo; I axed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Only the <i>Times</i>&rsquo;, said the gemman,
&lsquo;that&rsquo;s all.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then, turning to his
friend, he said, &lsquo;Come on, Jack, the gemman wants it in, so
we&rsquo;ll have it in, every word, and where he comes from too,
and all about the gal; we know all about it, don&rsquo;t us,
Jack?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said the O&rsquo;Rapley, blowing out a large
cloud, and fixing his eye on the middle stump.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued Bumpkin, &ldquo;thee could
ha&rsquo; knocked I down wi&rsquo; a feather.&nbsp; How the doose
they knowed where I comed from I can&rsquo;t make out; but here
wur I <!-- page 217--><a name="page217"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 217</span>as cloase to the man as writes the
<i>Times</i> as I be to thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The O&rsquo;Rapley nodded his head knowingly several
times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, and how much do thee charge to keep un
out?&rsquo; seys I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be too hard upon me,
I be only a poor man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We have only one charge,&rsquo; says the
<i>Times</i>, &lsquo;and that is half a guinea.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Spoase we say seven and six,&rsquo; sess I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That,&rsquo; seys the <i>Times</i>,
&lsquo;wouldn&rsquo;t keep your name out, and I suppose you
don&rsquo;t want that in?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; I
sess, takin&rsquo; out my leather bag and handin&rsquo; him the
money; &lsquo;this&rsquo;ll keep un out, wool ur?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sartainly,&rsquo; says he; and then his friend
Jack says, &lsquo;My fee be five shillings, sir.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;And who be thee?&rsquo; says I.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m the
<i>Telegrarf</i>,&rsquo; seys he.&nbsp; &lsquo;The devil thee
be?&rsquo; I sess, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve eerd tell on
ee.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Largest calculation in the world,&rsquo;
he says; &lsquo;and, if thee like,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;I can
take the <i>Daily Noos</i> and <i>Stanard</i> money, for I
don&rsquo;t see &rsquo;em here jist now; it&rsquo;ll be five
shillings apiece.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; I sess, &lsquo;this be rum
business, this; if I takes a quantity like this, can&rsquo;t it
be done a little cheaper?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; he says; &lsquo;we stands too high
for anything o&rsquo; that sort.&nbsp; Thee can &rsquo;ave it or
leave it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; I sess; &lsquo;then, if
there&rsquo;s no option, there&rsquo;s the money.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And with that I handed un the fifteen shillings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then,&rsquo; says the <i>Times</i>,
&lsquo;we&rsquo;d better look sharp, Jack, or else we
shan&rsquo;t be in time to keep it out.&rsquo;&nbsp; And
wi&rsquo; that they hurried off as fast as they could.&nbsp; I
will say&rsquo;t they didn&rsquo;t let the grass grow under their
feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 218--><a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
218</span>&ldquo;And why,&rdquo; enquired the Don, with an amused
smile, &ldquo;were you so anxious to keep it out of the
<i>Times</i>?&nbsp; Mrs. Bumpkin doesn&rsquo;t read the
<i>Times</i>, does she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no; but then the Squoire tak it in, and when eve
done wi un he lends un to the Doctor, Mr. Gossip; and when he
gets hold o&rsquo; anything, away it goes to the Parish Clerk,
Mr. Jeerum, and then thee med as well hire the town crier at
once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see; but if you&rsquo;ll excuse me, Mr. Bumpkin, I
will give you a bit of information that may be of
service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thankee, sir; will thee jist tak a little more to wet
the tother eye like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, really,&rdquo; replied O&rsquo;Rapley, &ldquo;it
is long past my hour of nocturnal repose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, sir?&nbsp; I doant ondustand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean to say that I generally hook it off to bed
before this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zackly; but we&rsquo;ll &rsquo;ave another.&nbsp; Your
leave, sir, thee was going to tell I zummat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O yes,&rdquo; said Mr. O&rsquo;Rapley, with a wave of
the hand in imitation of the Lord Chief Justice.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
was going to say that those two men were a couple of
rogues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bumpkin paused in the act of passing the tumbler to his
lips, like one who feels he has been artfully taken in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been done, sir!&rdquo; said Mr.
O&rsquo;Rapley emphatically, &ldquo;that man who said he was the
<i>Times</i> was no more the <i>Times</i> than you&rsquo;re
<i>Punch</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor thic <i>Telegrarf</i> feller!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; And you could prosecute them.&nbsp; And
I&rsquo;ll tell you what you could prosecute them
for.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Bumpkin looked almost stupified.</p>
<p><!-- page 219--><a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
219</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what these villains have
been guilty of; they&rsquo;ve been guilty of obtaining money by
false pretences, and conspiring to obtain money by false
pretences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have um?&rdquo; said Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you can prosecute them.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve only got
to go and put the matter in the hands of the police, and then go
to some first-rate solicitor who attends police courts; now I can
recommend you one that will do you justice.&nbsp; I should like
to see these rascals well punished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And will this fust-rate attorney do un for
nothin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, hardly; any more than you would sell him a pig for
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I shan&rsquo;t prosekit,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumpkin;
&ldquo;the devil&rsquo;s in&rsquo;t, I be no sooner out o&rsquo;
one thing than I be into another&mdash;why I beant out o&rsquo;
thic watch job yet, for I got to &rsquo;pear at the Old Bailey on
the twenty-fourth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, committed for trial, was he?&rdquo; exclaimed the
Don.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure wur ur,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumpkin
triumphantly&mdash;&ldquo;guilty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now I perceived that the wily Mr. O&rsquo;Rapley did not
recommend Bumpkin to obtain the services of a solicitor to
conduct his prosecution in this case; and I apprehend for this
reason, that the said solicitor being conscientious, would
unquestionably recommend and insist that Mr. Bumpkin&rsquo;s
evidence at the Old Bailey should be supported by that of the Don
himself.&nbsp; So Mr. Bumpkin was left to the tender mercies of
the Public Prosecutor or a criminal tout, or the most
inexperienced of &ldquo;soup&rdquo; instructed counsel, as the
case might be, but of which matters at present I have no
knowledge as I have no dreams of the future.</p>
<p><!-- page 220--><a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
220</span>Then Mr. Bumpkin said, &ldquo;By thy leave, worthy Mr.
O&rsquo;Rapley, I will just see what my head witness be about: he
be a sharp lad enow, but wants a dale o&rsquo; lookin
arter.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 221--><a name="page221"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 221</span>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Don O&rsquo;Rapley expresses his views of the
policy of the legislature in not permitting dominoes to be played
in public houses.</p>
<p>When Mr. Bumpkin returned to the cosy parlour, his face was
red and his teeth were set.&nbsp; He was so much agitated indeed,
that instead of addressing Mr. O&rsquo;Rapley, he spoke to Mrs.
Oldtimes, as though in her female tenderness he might find a more
sincere and sympathetic adviser.</p>
<p>Mr. Bumpkin was never what you would call an eloquent or
fluent speaker: his Somersetshire brogue was at times difficult
of comprehension.&nbsp; He certainly was not fluent when he said
to Mrs. Oldtimes: &ldquo;Why thic&mdash;there&mdash;damn un Mrs.
Oldtimes if he beant gwine and never zeed zich a thing in my
bornd days&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why what ever in the name of goodness gracious is the
matter?&rdquo; asked the landlady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why thic there head witness o&rsquo; mine: a
silly-brained&mdash;Gor forgive me that iver I should spake so
o&rsquo; un, for he wor allays a good chap; and I do
b&rsquo;leeve he&rsquo;ve got moore sense than do any thing
o&rsquo; that kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? what&rsquo;s the
matter?&rdquo; again enquired Mrs. Oldtimes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why he be playin&rsquo; dominoes wi thic
Sergeant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O,&rdquo; said the landlady, &ldquo;I was afraid
something had <!-- page 222--><a name="page222"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 222</span>happened.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re not
allowed to know anything about dominoes or card-playing in our
house&mdash;the Law forbids our knowing it, Mr. Bumpkin; so, if
you please, we will not talk about it&mdash;I wish to conduct my
house as it always has been for the last five-and-twenty years,
in peace and quietness and respectability, Mr. Bumpkin, which
nobody can never say to the contrairy.&nbsp; It was only the last
licensing day Mr. Twiddletwaddle, the chairman of the Bench, said
as it were the best conducted house in Westminster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now whether it was that the report of this domino playing was
made in the presence of so high a dignitary of the law as Mr.
O&rsquo;Rapley, or from any other cause, I cannot say, but Mrs.
Oldtimes was really indignant, and positively refused to accept
any statement which involved the character of her
establishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; she continued, addressing Mr.
O&rsquo;Rapley, &ldquo;you have known this house for some time,
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Rapley.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have
passed it every evening for the last ten years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah now, to be sure&mdash;you hear that, Mr.
Bumpkin.&nbsp; What do you think of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never saw anything wrong, I will say that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never a game in my house, if I knows it; and
what&rsquo;s more, I won&rsquo;t believe it until I sees
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ockelar demonstration, that&rsquo;s the law,&rdquo;
said the Don.</p>
<p>Mr. Bumpkin&rsquo;s excitement was absolutely merged in that
of the landlady, whom he had so innocently provoked.&nbsp; He
stared as the parties continued their wordy justification of this
well-ruled household like one dreaming with his eyes open.&nbsp;
No woman could have made more ado about her own character than
Mrs. Oldtimes did respecting that of her house.&nbsp; But then,
<!-- page 223--><a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
223</span>the one could be estimated in money, while the other
possessed but an abstract value.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; she repeated, &ldquo;that cards or
dominoes has never been played in my house since here I&rsquo;ve
been, or since the law has been what it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I be wery sorry,&rdquo; said the penitent Bumpkin;
&ldquo;I warn&rsquo;t aweare I wur doing anythin&rsquo;
wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s unlawful, you see, to play,&rdquo; said the
Don; &ldquo;and consequently they dursn&rsquo;t play.&nbsp; Now,
why is it unlawful?&nbsp; Because Public Houses is for drinking,
not for amusement.&nbsp; Now, sir, Drink is the largest tax-payer
we&rsquo;ve got&mdash;therefore Drink&rsquo;s an important
Industry.&nbsp; Set people to work drinking and you get a good
Rewenue, which keeps up the Army and Navy&mdash;the Navy swims in
liquor, sir&mdash;but let these here Perducers of the Rewenue
pause for the sake o&rsquo; playing dominoes, or what not, and
what&rsquo;s the consequence?&nbsp; You check this important
industry&mdash;therefore don&rsquo;t by any manner of means
interrupt drinking.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s an agreeable ockepation and
a paying one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well done, sir,&rdquo; said Oldtimes, from the corner
of the fireplace, where he was doing his best with only one mouth
and one constitution to keep up the Army and Navy.&nbsp; A
patriotic man was Oldtimes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drink,&rdquo; continued O&rsquo;Rapley, &ldquo;is the
most powerful horgsilery the Government has.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Mr. Bumpkin, not knowing what a
horgsilery was; &ldquo;now thee&rsquo;ve gone a-head o&rsquo; me,
sir.&nbsp; Thee&rsquo;re a larned man, Mr. O&rsquo;Rapley, and I
beant much of a schollard; will thee please to tell I what a
horgs&mdash;what wur it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horgsilery,&rdquo; said Mr. O&rsquo;Rapley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horsgilly&mdash;ah! so twur.&nbsp; Well, by thy leave,
<!-- page 224--><a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
224</span>worthy sir, will thee be so kind as to tell I be it
anything like a hogshead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. O&rsquo;Rapley, &ldquo;its more
like a corkscrew: the taxes of the country would be bottled up as
tight as champagne and you couldn&rsquo;t get &rsquo;em out
without this corkscrew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I worn&rsquo;t spakin&rsquo; about taxes when I
spak of dominoes; what I wur alludin&rsquo; to wur thic Joe been
drawed in to goo for a soger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lor, bless you,&rdquo; said Mrs. Oldtimes, &ldquo;many
a man as good as Joe have listed before now and will
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mayhap,&rdquo; said Bumpkin; &ldquo;but he wurn&rsquo;t
my &rsquo;ead witness and didn&rsquo;t work for I.&nbsp; Joe be
my right hand man, although I keeps un down and tells un he beant
fit for nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha,&rdquo; said the Don, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s not likely
to go for a soldier, I think, if it&rsquo;s that good-looking
young chap I saw with the kicking-straps on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kickin&rsquo;-straps,&rdquo; said Bumpkin; &ldquo;haw!
haw! haw!&nbsp; That be a good un.&nbsp; Well he told I he wur up
to un and I think ur be: he&rsquo;ll be a clever feller if ur
gets our Joe.&nbsp; Why Nancy ud goo amost out o&rsquo; her
mind.&nbsp; And now, sir, will thee &rsquo;ave any
moore?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. O&rsquo;Rapley, in the most decisive but polite manner,
refused.&nbsp; He had quite gone out of his way as it was in the
hope of serving Mr. Bumpkin.&nbsp; He was sure that the thief
would be convicted, and as he rose to depart seized his
friend&rsquo;s hand in the most affectionate manner.&nbsp;
Anything he could do for him he was sure he would do cheerfully,
at any amount of self-sacrifice&mdash;he would get up in the
night to serve him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thankee,&rdquo; said Bumpkin; but he had hardly spoken
when he was startled by the most uproarious cheers from <!-- page
225--><a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
225</span>the taproom.&nbsp; And then he began again about the
folly of young men getting into the company of recruiting
sergeants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said the Don, confidentially,
&ldquo;take my advice&mdash;say nothing&mdash;a still tongue
makes a wise head; to persuade a man not to enter the army is
tantamount to advising him to desert.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t
mind, you may lay yourself open to a prosecution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zounds!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Bumpkin, &ldquo;it seem to
me a man in Lunnon be every minit liable to a prosecution for
zummat.&nbsp; I hope sayin&rsquo; that beant contempt o&rsquo;
Coourt, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. O&rsquo;Rapley was silent&mdash;his head drooped towards
Mr. Bumpkin in a semi-conscious manner, and he nodded three
consecutive times: called for another &ldquo;seroot,&rdquo; lit
it after many efforts, and again assuring Mr. Bumpkin that he
would do all he could towards facilitating his triumph over
Snooks, was about to depart, when his friend asked him,
confidentially, whether he had not better be at the Old Bailey
when the trial came on, in case of its being necessary to call
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shurel not!&rdquo; hiccupped the Don.&nbsp; Then he
pointed his finger, and leering at Bumpkin, repeated,
&ldquo;Shurel not;&mdash;jus swell cll Ch.
Jussiself&rdquo;&mdash;which being interpreted meant,
&ldquo;Certainly not, you might just as well call the Chief
Justice himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pr&rsquo;aps he&rsquo;ll try un?&rdquo; said
Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noer won&rsquo;t&mdash;noer won&rsquo;t: Chansy Juge
mos likel Massr Rolls.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 227--><a name="page227"></a><span

<p class="gutsumm">In spite of all warnings, Joe takes his own
part, not to be persuaded on one side or the
other&mdash;affecting scene between Mr. Bumpkin and his old
servant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever can that there shoutin&rsquo; be for, Mrs.
Oldtimes&mdash;they be terrible noisy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O,&rdquo; said the landlady, &ldquo;somebody else has
listed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope it beant that silly Joe.&nbsp; I warned un two
or three times agin thic feller.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There have been several to-night,&rdquo; said the
landlady, who had scarcely yet recovered from the insinuations
against the character of her house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How does thee know thic, my dear lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, because Miss Prettyface have been in and out
sewin&rsquo; the colours on all the evening, that&rsquo;s
all.&nbsp; Sergeant Goodtale be the best recrootin&rsquo;
sergeant ever come into a town&mdash;he&rsquo;d list his own
father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would ur, now?&rdquo; said Bumpkin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Beant
thee afeard o&rsquo; thy husband bein&rsquo; took?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Oldtimes shrieked with laughter, and said she wished he
would list Tom, for he wasn&rsquo;t any good except to sit in the
chimney corner and smoke and drink from morning to night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And keep up th&rsquo; Army,&rdquo; growled the
husband</p>
<p><!-- page 228--><a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
228</span>&ldquo;Ha, keep up the Army, indeed,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Oldtimes; &ldquo;you do your share in that way, I
grant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now it was quite manifest that that last cheer from the
taproom was the herald of the company&rsquo;s departure.&nbsp;
There was a great scuffling and stamping of feet as of a general
clearing out, and many &ldquo;good nights.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then the
big manly voice of the Sergeant said: &ldquo;Nine o&rsquo;clock,
lads; nine o&rsquo;clock; don&rsquo;t oversleep yourselves; we
shall have chops at eight.&nbsp; What d&rsquo;ye say to that,
Mrs. Oldtimes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you please, Sergeant; but there&rsquo;s a nice piece
of ham, if any would like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said the Sergeant; &ldquo;now, how many
would like ham?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;se for a chop,&rdquo; said Joe, working his
mouth as if he would get it in training.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; said the Sergeant, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll see
about breakfast in the morning.&nbsp; But you know, Mrs.
Oldtimes, we like to start with a good foundation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with three cheers for the Sergeant the recruits left the
house: all except Joe, who occupied his old room.</p>
<p>After they were gone, and while Mr. Bumpkin was confidentially
conversing with the landlord in the chimney corner, he was
suddenly aroused by the indomitable Joe bursting into the room
and performing a kind of dance or jig, the streamers, meanwhile,
in his hat, flowing and flaunting in the most audaciously
military manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halloa! halloa! zounds!&nbsp; What be th&rsquo; meaning
o&rsquo; all this?&nbsp; Why, Joe!&nbsp; Joe! thee&rsquo;s never
done it, lad!&nbsp; O dear! dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were the colours as plain as possible in Joe&rsquo;s
<!-- page 229--><a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
229</span>hat, and there was a wild unmeaning look in his
eyes.&nbsp; It seemed already as if the old intimacy between him
and his master were at an end.&nbsp; His memory was more a thing
of the future than the past: he recollected the mutton chops that
were to come.&nbsp; And I verily believe it was brightened by the
dawn of new hopes and aspirations.&nbsp; There was an awakening
sense of individuality.&nbsp; Hitherto he had been the property
of another: he had now exercised the right of ownership over
himself; and although that act had transferred him to another
master, it had seemed to give him temporary freedom, and to have
conferred upon him a new existence.</p>
<p>Man is, I suppose, what his mind is, and Joe&rsquo;s mind was
as completely changed as if he had been born into a different
sphere.&nbsp; The moth comes out of the grub, the gay Hussar out
of the dull ploughman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Joe, Joe,&rdquo; said his old master.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thee&rsquo;s never gone an&rsquo; listed, has thee,
Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lookee &rsquo;ere, maister,&rdquo; said the recruit,
taking off his hat and spreading out the
colours&mdash;&ldquo;Thee sees these here, maister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thee beant such a fool, Joe, I knows thee
beant&mdash;thee&rsquo;s been well brought oop&mdash;and I knows
thee beant gwine to leave I and goo for a soger!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I be listed, maister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Bumpkin.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
wunt b&rsquo;lieve it, Joe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then thee must do tother thing, maister.&nbsp; I tellee
I be listed; now, what&rsquo;s thee think o&rsquo;
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That thee be a fool,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumpkin, angrily;
&ldquo;thee be a silly-brained&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop a bit, maister, no moore o&rsquo; that.&nbsp; I
beant thy <!-- page 230--><a name="page230"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 230</span>sarvant now.&nbsp; I be a
Queen&rsquo;s man&mdash;I be in the Queen&rsquo;s
sarvice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pooty Queen&rsquo;s man thee be, surely.&nbsp; Why
look at thic hair all down over thy face, and thee be as red as a
poppy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now I perceived that although neither master nor man was in
such a state as could be described as &ldquo;intoxicated,&rdquo;
yet both were in that semi-beatific condition which may be called
sentimental.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lookee &rsquo;ere, maister,&rdquo; continued Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And lookee here,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumpkin,
&ldquo;didn&rsquo;t I come out to thee two or three times, and
call thee out and tell &rsquo;ee to tak&rsquo; heed to thic soger
feller, for he wur up to no good?&nbsp; Did I Joe, or did I
not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thee did, maister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, an&rsquo; now look where thee be; he&rsquo;ve
regler took thee in, thee silly fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he beant; for he wouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;ave I at
fust, and told I to goo and ax my mither.&nbsp; No ses I,
I&rsquo;ll goo to the divil afore I be gwine to ax mither.&nbsp;
I beant a child, I ses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But thee&rsquo;s fond o&rsquo; thy poor old mither,
Joe; I knows thee be, and sends her a shillin&rsquo; a week out
o&rsquo; thy wages; don&rsquo;t thee, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was an awkward thrust, and pricked the lad in his most
sensitive part.&nbsp; His under-lip drooped, his mouth twitched,
and his eyes glistened.&nbsp; He was silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;ll thy poor old mither get a shilling a
week from noo, Joe?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what I wants to
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe drew his sleeve over his face, but bore up bravely
withal.&nbsp; <i>He</i> wasn&rsquo;t going to cry, not he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thee beest a silly feller to leave a good ooame and
nine shillin&rsquo; a week to goo a sogerin; and when thee was

Joe, at the fireside: now, warnt there, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lookee &rsquo;ere, maister, I be for betterin&rsquo;
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Betterin&rsquo; thyself? who put that into thy silly
pate? thic sergeant, I bleeve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So ur did; not by anything ur said, but to see un wi
beef steaks and ingons for supper, while I doan&rsquo;t
&rsquo;ave a mouthful o&rsquo; mate once a week, and work like a

<p>&ldquo;Poor silly feller&mdash;O dear, dear! whatever wool I
tell Nancy and thy poor mither.&nbsp; What redgimen be thee in,
Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hooroars!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hooroars! hoo-devils!&rdquo; and I perceived that Mr.
Bumpkin&rsquo;s eyes began to glisten as he more and more
realized the fact that Joe was no more to him&mdash;&ldquo;thee
manest the oosors, thee silly feller; a pooty oosor thee&rsquo;ll
make!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tellee what,&rdquo; said Joe, whose pride was now
touched, &ldquo;Maister Sergeant said I wur the finest made chap
he ever see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s ow ur gulled thee, Joe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noa didn&rsquo;t; I went o&rsquo; my own free
will.&nbsp; No man should persuade I&mdash;trust Joe for thic:
couldn&rsquo;t persuade I to goo, nor yet not to goo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; chimed in Miss Prettyface,
with her sweet little voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And thee sewed the colours on; didn&rsquo;t thee,
Miss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; answered the young lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumpkin, &ldquo;I be mortal sorry
for thee; what&rsquo;ll I do wirout thy evidence?&nbsp; Lawyer
Prigg say thee&rsquo;s the most wallible witness for
I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha, Joe, it were drink done it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noa, noa, never!&mdash;good-night, maister, and God
bless thee&mdash;thee been a good maister, and I been a good
sarvant.&nbsp; I shall allays think o&rsquo; thee and Missis,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here I saw that Mr. Bumpkin, what with his feelings and what
with his gin-and-water, was well nigh overcome with
emotion.&nbsp; Nor was it to be wondered at; he was in London a
stranger, waiting for a trial with a neighbour, with whom for
years he had been on friendly terms; his hard savings were fast
disappearing; his stock and furniture were mortgaged; some of it
had been sold, and his principal witness and faithful servant was
now gone for a soldier.&nbsp; In addition to all this, poor Mr.
Bumpkin could not help recalling the happiness of his past life,
his early struggles, his rigid self-denial, his <!-- page
234--><a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
234</span>pleasure as the modest savings accumulated&mdash;not so
much occasioned by the sordid desire of wealth, as the nobler
wish to be independent.&nbsp; Then there was Mrs. Bumpkin, who
naturally crossed his mind at this miserable moment in his
existence&mdash;at home by herself&mdash;faithful, hardworking
woman, who believed not only in her husband&rsquo;s wisdom, but
in his luck.&nbsp; She had never liked this going to law, and
would much rather have given Snooks the pig than it should have
come about; yet she could not help believing that her husband
must be right come what may.&nbsp; What would she think of
Joe&rsquo;s leaving them in this way?&nbsp; All this passed
through the shallow mind of the farmer as he prepared for
bed.&nbsp; And there was no getting away from his thoughts, try
as he would.&nbsp; As he lay on his bed there passed before his
mind the old farm-house, with its elm tree; and the barnyard,
newly littered down with the sweet smelling fodder; the orchard
blossoms smiling in the morning sunshine; the pigs routing
through the straw; the excited ducks and the swifter fowls
rushing towards Mrs. Bumpkin as she came out to shake the
tablecloth; the sleek and shining cows; the meadows dotted all
over with yellow buttercups; the stately bull feeding in the
distance by himself; the lazy stream that pursued its even course
without a quarrel or a lawsuit; all these, and a thousand other
remembrances of home, passed before the excited and somewhat
distempered vision of the farmer on this unhappy night.&nbsp; Had
he been a criminal waiting his trial he could not have been more
wretched.&nbsp; At length he endeavoured to console himself by
thinking of Snooks: tried to believe that victory over that
ill-disposed person would repay the trouble and anxiety it cost
him to achieve.&nbsp; But no, not even revenge was sweet under
his <!-- page 235--><a name="page235"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 235</span>present circumstances.&nbsp; It is
always an apple of ashes at the best; but, weighed now against
the comforts and happiness of a peaceful life, it was worse than
ashes&mdash;it was poison.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Here I awoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;is it not just as I
told you?&nbsp; I knew that artful Sergeant would enlist poor
stupid Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O,&rdquo; quoth I, &ldquo;have I been talking
again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than ever; and I am very sorry Joe has deserted
his kind master.&nbsp; I am afraid now he will lose his
case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not concerned about that at present; my work is
but to dream, not to prophesy events.&nbsp; I hope Mr. Bumpkin
will win, but nothing is so uncertain as the Law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why should that be?&nbsp; Law should be as certain
as the Multiplication Table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; sighed I, &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man who brings an action must be right or
wrong,&rdquo; interrupted my wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and sometimes he&rsquo;s
both; and one judge will take one view of his case&mdash;his
conduct out of Court, and his demeanour in&mdash;while another
judge will take another; why, I have known a man lose his case
through having a wart upon his nose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious!&rdquo; exclaimed my wife, &ldquo;is it
possible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; quoth I; &ldquo;and another through having
a twitch in his eye.&nbsp; Then you may have a foolish jury, who
take a prejudice against a man.&nbsp; For instance, if a lawyer
brings an action, he can seldom get justice before a common jury;
and so if he be sued.&nbsp; A blue ribbon <!-- page 236--><a
name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>man on the
jury will be almost sure to carry his extreme virtue to the
border of injustice against a publican.&nbsp; Masters decide
against workmen, and so on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Bumpkin is not a lawyer, or a publican, or a
blue ribbon man, so I hope he&rsquo;ll win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t hope anything about it,&rdquo; I
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall note down what takes place; I
don&rsquo;t care who wins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When will his case at the Old Bailey come on?&nbsp; I
think that&rsquo;s the term you use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be tried next week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is sure to punish that wicked thief who stole his
watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One would think so: much will depend upon the way Mr.
Bumpkin gives his evidence; much on the way in which the thief is
defended; a good deal on the ability of the Counsel for the
Prosecution; and very much on the class of man they get in the
jury box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the case is so clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, to us who know all about it; but you have to make
it clear to the jury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the watch found upon the man.&nbsp; Why,
dear me, what can be clearer or plainer than that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True; that&rsquo;s Mr. Bumpkin&rsquo;s
evidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Mr. Bumpkin saw him take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Bumpkin again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Mr. O&rsquo;Rapley was with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you not hear that he is not to be called; the Don
doesn&rsquo;t want to be seen in the affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I feel certain he will win.&nbsp; I shall not
believe in trial by jury if they let that man off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what a trial at the Old Bailey or
Quarter Sessions is.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mean at the Old Bailey
<!-- page 237--><a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
237</span>before a real Common Law judge, but a Chancery
judge.&nbsp; I once heard a counsel, who was prosecuting a man
for passing bad money, interrupt a recorder in his summing up,
and ask him to tell the jury there was evidence of seven bad
florins having been found in the prisoner&rsquo;s boot.&nbsp; As
guilty knowledge was the gist of the offence, this seemed
somewhat important.&nbsp; The learned young judge, turning to the
jury, said, in a hesitating manner, &lsquo;Well, really,
gentlemen, I don&rsquo;t know whether that will affect your
judgment in any way; there is the evidence, and you may consider
it if you please.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One more thing I should like to ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t they get Mr. Bumpkin&rsquo;s case
tried?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because there is no system.&nbsp; In the County Court,
where a judge tries three times as many cases in a day as any
Superior judge, cases are tried nearly always on the day they are
set down for.&nbsp; At the Criminal Courts, where every case is
at least as important as any Civil case, everyone gets tried
without unnecessary delay.&nbsp; In the Common Law Courts
it&rsquo;s very much like hunt the slipper&mdash;you hardly ever
know which Court the case is in for five minutes together.&nbsp;
Then they sit one day and not another, to the incalculable
expense of the suitors, who may come up from Devonshire to-night,
and, after waiting a week, go back and return again to town at
the end of the following month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, now that O&rsquo;Rapley has taken the matter up,
is there not some hope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he seems to have as much power as
anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I hope he&rsquo;ll exert it; for it&rsquo;s a
shame that this poor man should be kept waiting about so
long.&nbsp; I <!-- page 238--><a name="page238"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 238</span>quite feel for him: there really
ought not to be so much delay in the administration of
justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dilatory administration of justice amounts too often
to a denial of it altogether.&nbsp; It always increases the
expense, and often results in absolute ruin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder men don&rsquo;t appoint someone when they fell
out to arbitrate between them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They often do, and too frequently, after all the
expense of getting ready for trial has been incurred, the case is
at last sent to the still more costly tribunal called a
reference.&nbsp; Many matters cannot be tried by a jury, but many
can be that are not; one side clamouring for a reference in order
to postpone the inevitable result; the other often obliged to
submit and be defeated by mere lapse of time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems an endless sort of business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite; the measure of it is too frequently the
length of the purse on the one side or the other.&nbsp; A Railway
Company, who has been cast in damages for &pound;1,000, can soon
wear out a poor plaintiff.&nbsp; One of the greatest evils of
modern litigation is the frequency with which new trials are
granted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lawyers,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;are not apparently
good men of business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are not organizers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wants such a man as General Wolseley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely.&rdquo;&nbsp; And here I felt the usual
drowsiness which the subject invariably produces.&nbsp; So I
dreamed again.</p>
<h2><!-- page 239--><a name="page239"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 239</span>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Morning reflections&mdash;Mrs. Oldtimes proves
herself to be a great philosopher&mdash;the departure of the
recruits to be sworn in.</p>
<p>And as I dreamed, methought what a strange paradox is human
nature.&nbsp; How often the night&rsquo;s convivialities are
followed by despondent morning reflections!&nbsp; In the evening
we grow valiant over the inspiriting converse and the inspiring
glass; in the morning we are tame and calculating.&nbsp; The
artificial gaslight disappears, and the sober, grey morning
breaks in upon our reason.&nbsp; If the sunshine only ripened
one-half the good resolves and high purposes formed at night over
the social glass, what a harvest of good deeds there would
be!&nbsp; Yes, and if the evening dissipations did not obliterate
the good resolves of the morning, which we so often form as a
protection against sin and sorrow, what happy creatures we should
be!</p>
<p>Methought I looked into a piece of three-cornered glass, which
was resting on a ledge of the old wall in the room where Joe was
sleeping, and that I read therein the innermost thoughts of this
country lad.&nbsp; And I saw that he awoke to a very dreadful
sense of the realities of his new position; that, one after
another, visions of other days passed before his mind&rsquo;s eye
as he lay gazing at the dormer window of his narrow
chamber.&nbsp; What a <!-- page 240--><a name="page240"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 240</span>profound stillness there was!&nbsp;
How different from the roystering glee of the previous
night!&nbsp; It was a stillness that seemed to whisper of home;
of his poor old mother; of the green sward lane that led to the
old farm; of the old oak tree, where the owls lived, and ghosts
were said to take up their quarters; of the stile where, of a
Sunday morning, he used to smoke his pipe with Jack, and Ned, and
Charley; where he had often stood to see Polly go by to church;
and he knew that, notwithstanding she would not so much as look
at him, he loved her down to the very sole of her boot; and would
stand and contemplate the print of her foot after she had passed;
he didn&rsquo;t know why, for there was nothing in it, after
all.&nbsp; No, Joe, nothing in it&mdash;it was in you; that makes
all the difference.&nbsp; And the voice whispered to him of sunny
days in the bright fields, when he held the plough, and the sly
old rook would come bobbing and pecking behind him; and the
little field-mouse would flit away from its turned up nest,
frightened to death, as if it were smitten with an earthquake;
and the skylark would dart up over his head, letting fall a song
upon him, as though it were Heaven&rsquo;s blessing.&nbsp; Then
the voice spoke of the noontide meal under the hedge in the warm
sunshine, or in the shade of the cool spreading tree; of the
horses feeding close up alongside the hedge; of the going home in
the evening, and the warm fireside, and the rustic song, and of
the thousand and one beloved associations that he was leaving and
casting behind him for ever.&nbsp; But then, again, he thought of
&ldquo;bettering his condition,&rdquo; of getting on in the
world, of the smart figure he should look in the eyes of Polly,
who would be sure now to like him better <!-- page 241--><a
name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 241</span>than she
liked the baker.&nbsp; He never could see what there was in the
baker that any girl should care for; and he thought of what the
Sergeant had said about asking his mother&rsquo;s leave.&nbsp;
And then he pondered on the beef steaks and onions and mutton
chops, and other glories of a soldier&rsquo;s life; so he got up
with a brave, resolute heart to face the world like a man,
although it was plainly visible that sorrow struggled in his
eyes.</p>
<p>There was just one tear for old times, the one tear that
showed how very human Joe was beneath all the rough incrustations
with which ignorance and poverty had enveloped him.</p>
<p>As he was sousing his head and neck in a pail of cold water in
the little backyard of the Inn, the thought occurred to
him,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder whether or no we &rsquo;gins these &rsquo;ere
mutton chops for brakfast to-day or arter we&rsquo;re sweared
in.&nbsp; I expects not till arter we&rsquo;re sweared
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then his head went into the pail with a dash, as if that was
part of the swearing-in process.&nbsp; As it came out he was
conscious of a twofold sensation, which it may not be out of
place to describe: the sensation produced by the water, which was
refreshing in the highest degree, and the sensation produced by
what is called wind, which was also deliciously refreshing; and
it was in this wise.&nbsp; Borne along upon the current of air
which passed through the kitchen, there was the most odoriferous
savour of fried bacon that the most luxurious appetite could
enjoy.&nbsp; It was so beautifully and voluptuously fragrant that
Joe actually stopped while in the act of soaping his face that he
might enjoy it.&nbsp; No one, I think, will deny that it must
have been an <!-- page 242--><a name="page242"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 242</span>agreeable odour that kept a man
waiting with his eyes fall of soap for half a minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That beant amiss,&rdquo; thought Joe; &ldquo;I wonder
whether it be for I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The problem was soon solved, for as he entered the kitchen
with a face as bright and ruddy almost as the sun when he comes
up through a mist, he saw the table was laid out for five, and
all the other recruits had already assembled.&nbsp; There was not
one who did not look well up to his resolution, and I must say a
better looking lot of recruits were never seen: they were tall,
well made, healthy, good-looking fellows.</p>
<p>Now Mrs. Oldtimes was busy at the kitchen fire; the frying-pan
was doing its best to show what could be done for Her
Majesty&rsquo;s recruits.&nbsp; He was hissing bravely, and
seemed every now and then to give a louder and heartier welcome
to the company.&nbsp; As Joe came in I believe it fairly gave a
shout of enthusiasm, a kind of hooray.&nbsp; In addition to the
rashers that were frying, there was a large dish heaped up in
front of the fire, so that it was quite clear there would be no
lack, however hungry the company might be.</p>
<p>Then they sat down and every one was helped.&nbsp; Mrs.
Oldtimes was a woman of the world; let me also state she had a
deep insight into human nature.&nbsp; She knew the feelings of
her guests at this supreme moment, and how cheaply they could be
bought off at their present state of soldiering.&nbsp; She was
also aware that courage, fortitude, firmness, and the higher
qualities of the soul depend so much upon a contented stomach,
that she gave every one of her guests some nice gravy from the
pan.</p>
<p>It was a treat to see them eat.&nbsp; The Boardman was <!--
page 243--><a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
243</span>terrific, so was Jack.&nbsp; Harry seemed to have a
little more on his mind than the others, but this did not
interfere with his appetite; it simply affected his manner of
appeasing it.&nbsp; He seemed to be in love, for his manner was
somewhat reserved.&nbsp; At length the Sergeant came in, looking
so cheerful and radiant that one could hardly see him and not
wish to be a soldier.&nbsp; Then his cheery &ldquo;Well, lads;
good morning, lads,&rdquo; was so home-like that you almost
fancied soldiering consisted in sitting by a blazing kitchen fire
on a frosty morning and eating fried bacon.&nbsp; What a spirit
his presence infused into the company!&nbsp; He detected at a
glance the down-heartedness of Harry, and began a story about his
own enlistment years ago, when the chances for a young man of
education were nothing to what they are now.&nbsp; The story
seemed exactly to fit the circumstances of the case and cheered
Harry up wonderfully.&nbsp; Breakfast was nearly finished when
the Sergeant, after filling his pipe, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Comrades, what do you say; shall I wait till
you&rsquo;ve quite finished?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, Sergeant; no, no,&rdquo; said all.</p>
<p>Oh! the fragrance of that pipe!&nbsp; And the multiplied
fragrance of all the pipes!&nbsp; Then came smiling Miss
Prettyface to see if their ribbons were all right; and the
longing look of all the recruits was quite an affecting sight;
and the genial motherly good-natured best wishes of Mrs. Oldtimes
were very welcome.&nbsp; All these things were pleasant, and
proved Mrs. Oldtimes&rsquo; philosophy to be correct&mdash;if you
want to develop the higher virtues in a man, feed him.</p>
<p>Then came the word of command in the tone of an invitation to
a pleasure party: &ldquo;Now, lads, what do you <!-- page
244--><a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
244</span>say?&rdquo;&nbsp; And off went Harry, upright as if he
had been drilled; off went Bill, trying to shake off the deal
boards in which he had been sandwiched for a year and a half; off
went Bob as though he had found an agreeable occupation at last;
off went Devilmecare as though the war was only just the other
side of the road; off went Jack as though it mattered nothing to
him whether it was the Army or the Church; and, just as Mr.
Bumpkin looked out of the parlour window, off went his
&ldquo;head witness,&rdquo; swaggering along in imitation of the
Sergeant, with the colours streaming from his hat as though any
honest employment was better than hanging about London for a case
to &ldquo;come on.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 245--><a name="page245"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 245</span>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">A letter from home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said Mrs. Oldtimes, &ldquo;who this
letter be for; it have been &rsquo;ere now nigh upon a week, and
I&rsquo;m tired o&rsquo; seein&rsquo; it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Prettyface took the letter in her hand and began, as best
she could, for the twentieth time to endeavour to decipher the
address.&nbsp; It was very much blotted and besmeared, and
presented a very remarkable specimen of caligraphy.&nbsp; The
most legible word on it seemed &ldquo;Gouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nobody here of that name,&rdquo; said the
young lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you know anybody, Mr. Bumpkin, of the
name of Gouse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Devil a bit,&rdquo; said he, taking the letter in his
hands, and turning it over as if it had been a skittle-ball.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The postman said it belonged here,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Oldtimes, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t make un out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t read the postmark,&rdquo; said Miss
Prettyface.</p>
<p>Mr. Bumpkin put on a large pair of glasses and examined the
envelope with great care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ve got un upside down,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Oldtimes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! so ur be,&rdquo; replied the farmer, turning it
over several times.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;here be a <i>b</i>&mdash;<!-- page 246--><a
name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>and a
<i>u</i>, beant it?&nbsp; See if that beant a <i>u</i>, Miss,
your eyes be better un mine; they be younger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O yes, that&rsquo;s a <i>u</i>,&rdquo; said Miss
Prettyface, &ldquo;and an <i>m</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that spell <i>bum</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But stop,&rdquo; said Miss Prettyface,
&ldquo;here&rsquo;s a <i>p</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s <i>bump</i>,&rdquo; said Mrs. Oldtimes;
&ldquo;we shall get at something presently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; exclaimed Bumpkin, &ldquo;I be danged if I
doant think it be my old &rsquo;ooman&rsquo;s writin&rsquo;: but
I beant sure.&nbsp; That be the way ur twists the tail of ur
<i>y</i>&rsquo;s and <i>g</i>&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;ll swear; and
lookee &rsquo;ere, beant this <i>k i n</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it is,&rdquo; said the maid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, then, thee med be sure that be Bumpkin, and the
letter be for I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the young lady, &ldquo;and that other
word which looks more like Grouse is meant for Goose, the sign of
the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure be un,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Bumpkin, &ldquo;and
Nancy ha put Bumpkin and Goose all in one line, when ur ought to
ha made two lines ov un.&nbsp; Now look at that, that letter
might ha been partickler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it may be as it is,&rdquo; said Mrs. Oldtimes;
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s from Mrs. Bumpkin, no doubt.&nbsp; Aren&rsquo;t
you going to open it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I wool,&rdquo; said Bumpkin, turning the letter
round and round, and over and over, as though there was some
special private entrance which could only be discovered by the
closest search.&nbsp; At length Mrs. Oldtimes&rsquo; curiosity
was gratified, for he found a way in, and drew out the many
folded letter of the most difficult penmanship that ever was
subjected to mortal gaze.&nbsp; It was not that the writing was
illegible, but that the spelling was so extraordinary, and the
terms of expression <!-- page 247--><a name="page247"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 247</span>so varied.&nbsp; Had I to interpret
this letter without the aid of a dream I should have a long and
difficult task before me.&nbsp; But it is the privilege of
dreamers to see things clearly and in a moment: to live a
lifetime in a few seconds, and to traverse oceans in the space of
a single respiration.&nbsp; So, in the present instance, that
which took Mr. Bumpkin, with the help of Mrs. Oldtimes and the
occasional assistance of Lucy an hour to decipher, flashed before
me in a single second.&nbsp; I ought perhaps to translate it into
a more civilized language, but that would be impossible without
spoiling the effect and disturbing the continuity of character
which is so essential in a work made up of various actors.&nbsp;
Mr. Bumpkin himself in his ordinary costume would be no more out
of place in my Lord Mayor&rsquo;s state carriage than Mrs.
Bumpkin wielding the Queen&rsquo;s English in its statelier and
more fashionable adornment.&nbsp; So I give it as it was
written.&nbsp; It began in a bold but irregular hand, and clearly
indicated a certain agitation of mind not altogether in keeping
with the even temperament of the writer&rsquo;s daily life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deer Tom&rdquo; (the letter began), &ldquo;I ope thee

<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said Bumpkin, &ldquo;fust sarms

for thic Joe&mdash;lor, lor, Nancy, whatever will thee say, I
wonder, when thee knows he&rsquo;s gone for a soger&mdash;a sarm

<p>And then Mr. Bumpkin went and looked out of the window, and
thought over all the good news of Mrs. Bumpkin&rsquo;s letter,
and mentally calculated that even up to this time Mr.
Prigg&rsquo;s account would come to enough to pay the
year&rsquo;s rent.</p>
<p>Going to law seemed truly a most advantageous business.&nbsp;
Here he had got two shillings a quarter more for the oats than
the Squire had offered, and a pound more for the colt.&nbsp;
Prigg was a famous customer, and no doubt would buy the
hay.&nbsp; And, strange to say, just as <!-- page 249--><a
name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>Mr. Bumpkin
thought this, he happened to turn over the last page of the
letter, and there he saw what was really a Postscript.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halloo!&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;my dear, here be moore
on&rsquo;t; lookee &rsquo;ere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So there is,&rdquo; answered Lucy; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s
have a look.&rdquo;&nbsp; And thus she read:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The klover cut out well it made six lode the little rik
an four pun nineteen&nbsp; The Squoire ony offered four pun ten
so in corse I let Mister Prigg ave un.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well done, Nancy, thee be famous.&nbsp; Now, thic big
rik&rsquo;ll fetch moore&rsquo;n thic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such cheering intelligence put Mr. Bumpkin in good heart in
spite of his witness&rsquo;s desertion.&nbsp; Joe was a good
deal, but he wasn&rsquo;t money, and if he liked to go for a
soger, he must go; but, in Mr. Bumpkin&rsquo;s judgment, he would
very soon be tired of it, and wish himself back at his
fireside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, you must write to Mrs. Bumpkin,&rdquo; said
Lucy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thee&rsquo;ll write for I, my dear; won&rsquo;t
thee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you like,&rdquo; said Lucy.&nbsp; And so, after
dinner, when she had changed her dress, she proceeded to write an
epistle for Mrs. Bumpkin&rsquo;s edification.&nbsp; She had
<i>carte blanche</i> to put in what she liked, except that the
main facts were to be that Joe had gone for a horse soger; that
he expected &ldquo;the case would come on every day;&rdquo; and
that he had the highest opinion of the unquestioned ability of
honest Lawyer Prigg.</p>
<p>And now another surprise awaited the patient Bumpkin.&nbsp; As
he sat, later in the day, smoking his pipe, in company with Mrs.
Oldtimes, two men, somewhat <!-- page 250--><a
name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 250</span>shabbily
dressed, walked into the parlour and ordered refreshment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fine day, sir,&rdquo; said the elder of the two, a
man about thirty-five.&nbsp; This observation was addressed to
Mr. Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It be,&rdquo; said the farmer.</p>
<p>The other individual had seated himself near the fire, and was
apparently immersed in the study of the <i>Daily
Telegraph</i>.&nbsp; Suddenly he observed to his companion, as
though he had never seen it before,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallo! Ned, have you seen this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked the gentleman called
Ned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never read such a thing in my life.&nbsp; Just
listen.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;&lsquo;A YOUNG
MAN FROM THE COUNTRY.&rsquo;<br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">extraordinary story</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man, apparently about sixty-eight, who gave the name
of Bumpkin, appeared as the prosecutor in a case under the
following extraordinary circumstances.&nbsp; He said he was from
the country, but declined to give any more particular address,
and had been taken by a friend to see the Old Bailey and to hear
the trials at that Court.&nbsp; After leaving the Central
Criminal Court, he deposed, that, walking with his friend, he was
accosted in the Street in the open daylight and robbed of his
watch; that he pursued the thief, and when near Blackfriars
Bridge met a man coming towards him; that he seized the supposed
thief, and found him wearing the watch which he affirmed had been
stolen.&nbsp; The manner and appearance of &lsquo;the young man
from the country&rsquo; excited great laughter in Court, and the
Lord Mayor, in <!-- page 251--><a name="page251"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 251</span>the absence of any evidence to the
contrary, thought there was a <i>prim&acirc; facie</i> case under
the circumstances, and committed the accused for trial to the
Central Criminal Court.&nbsp; The prisoner, who was respectably
dressed, and against whom nothing appeared to be known, was most
ably defended by Mr. Nimble, who declined to put any questions in
cross-examination, and did not address his Lordship.&nbsp; The
case created great sensation, and it is expected that at the
trial some remarkable and astounding disclosures will be
made.&nbsp; &lsquo;The young man from the country&rsquo; was very
remarkably dressed: he twirled in his hand a large old-fashioned
white-beaver hat with a black band round it; wore a very peculiar
frock, elaborately ornamented with needlework in front and
behind, while a yellow kerchief with red ends was twisted round
his neck.&nbsp; The countryman declined to give his town address;
but a remarkable incident occurred during the hearing, which did
not seem to strike either the Lord Mayor or the counsel for the
defence, and that was that no appearance of the
countryman&rsquo;s companion was put in.&nbsp; Who he is and to
what region he belongs will probably transpire at the ensuing
trial, which is expected to be taken on the second day of the
next Sessions.&nbsp; It is obvious that while the case is <i>sub
judice</i> no comments can properly be made thereon, but we are
not prevented from saying that the evidence of this extraordinary
&lsquo;young man from the country&rsquo; will be subjected to the
most searching cross-examination of one of the ablest counsel of
the English Bar.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The two men looked at Mr. Bumpkin; while the latter coloured
until his complexion resembled beetroot.&nbsp; Miss Prettyface
giggled; and Mrs. Oldtimes winked at <!-- page 252--><a
name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>Mr.
Bumpkin, and shook her head in the most significant manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a rum case, sir,&rdquo; said Ned.</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe a word of the story,&rdquo; said
his companion.</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you believe,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;that that
man could have been wearing that watch if he&rsquo;d stole
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lor! won&rsquo;t Jemmy Nimble make mincemeat of
&rsquo;im!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Oldtimes looked frequently towards Mr. Bumpkin as she
continued her sewing, making the most unmistakeable signals that
under no circumstances was he to answer.&nbsp; It was apparent to
everyone, from Mr. Bumpkin&rsquo;s manner, that the paragraph
referred to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best thing that chap can do,&rdquo; said Ned,
&ldquo;is not to appear at the trial.&nbsp; He can easily keep
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re sure,&rdquo; answered the
other man; &ldquo;he knows a trick worth two of that.&nbsp; They
say the old chap deserted his poor old wife, after beating her
black and blue, and leaving her for dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It be a lie!&rdquo; exclaimed Bumpkin, thumping his
fist on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Ned, &ldquo;do you know anything about
it, sir?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s no odds to me, only a man can&rsquo;t
shut his ears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps I do and p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps I
doant; but it beant no bi&rsquo;niss o&rsquo; thine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean no offence, but anybody can read
the paper, surely; it&rsquo;s a free country.&nbsp;
P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps you&rsquo;re the man himself; I didn&rsquo;t
think o&rsquo; that.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 253--><a name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
253</span>&ldquo;P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps I be, and
p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps I beant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps your name is
Bumpkin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps it beant, and what
then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;ve nothing to do with it, that&rsquo;s
all; and I don&rsquo;t see why you should interfere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t have no quarrelling in my house,&rdquo;
said the landlady.&nbsp; &ldquo;This gentleman&rsquo;s nothing to
do with it; he knows nothing at all about it; so, if you please,
gentlemen, we needn&rsquo;t say any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want to talk about it,&rdquo;
said Ned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more do I,&rdquo; chimed in his companion;
&ldquo;but it&rsquo;s a pity that he should take up our
conversation when he hasn&rsquo;t anything to do with it, and his
name isn&rsquo;t Bumpkin, and he hasn&rsquo;t lost his
watch.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s no odds to me; I don&rsquo;t care, do
you, Ned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; said Ned; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s be off; I
don&rsquo;t want no row; anybody mustn&rsquo;t open his mouth
now.&nbsp; Good day, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the two young men went away.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">Mr. Bumpkin determines to maintain a discreet
silence about his case at the Old Bailey&mdash;Mr. Prigg confers
with him thereon.</p>
<p>And I saw that Mr. Bumpkin&rsquo;s case did not come on.&nbsp;
Day by day passed away, and still it was not in the paper.&nbsp;
The reason, however, is simple, and need not be told to any
except those of my readers who are under the impression that the
expeditious administration of justice is of any
consequence.&nbsp; It was obvious to the most simple-minded that
the case could not be taken for a day or two, because there was a
block in every one of the three Courts devoted to the trial of
Nisi Prius actions.&nbsp; And you know as well as anyone, Mr.
Bumpkin, that when you get a load of turnips, or what not, in the
market town blocked by innumerable other turnip carts, you must
wait.&nbsp; Patience, therefore, good Bumpkin.&nbsp; Justice may
be slow-footed, but she is sure handed; she may be blind and
deaf, but she is not dumb; as you shall see if you look into one
of the &ldquo;blocked Courts&rdquo; where a trial has been going
on for the last sixteen days.&nbsp; A case involving a dispute of
no consequence to any person in the world, and in which there is
absolutely nothing except&mdash;O rare phenomenon!&mdash;plenty
of money.&nbsp; It was interesting only on account of the
bickerings between the learned counsel, and the occasionally
friendly <!-- page 256--><a name="page256"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 256</span>altercations between the Bench and
the Bar.&nbsp; But the papers had written it into a <i>cause
c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i>, and made it a dramatic entertainment
for the beauty and the chivalry of England.&nbsp; So Mr. Bumpkin
had still to wait; but it enabled him to attend comfortably the
February sittings of the Old Bailey, where his other case was to
be tried.</p>
<p>When Mr. Prigg read the account of the proceedings before the
Lord Mayor, he was very much concerned, not to say annoyed,
because he was under the impression that he ought to have been
consulted.&nbsp; Not knowing what to do under the circumstances,
he resolved, after due consideration, to get into a hansom and
drive down to the &ldquo;Goose.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Prigg, as I have
before observed, was swift in decision and prompt in
action.&nbsp; He had no sooner resolved to see Bumpkin than to
Bumpkin he went.&nbsp; But his client was out; it was uncertain
when he would be in.&nbsp; Judge of Mr. Prigg&rsquo;s
disappointment!&nbsp; He left word that he would call again; he
did call again, and, after much dodging on the part of the wily
Bumpkin, he was obliged to surrender himself a captive to honest
Prigg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Mr. Bumpkin,&rdquo; exclaimed he, taking both
the hands of his client into his own and yielding him a double
measure of friendship; &ldquo;is it possible&mdash;have you been
robbed?&nbsp; Is it you in the paper this morning in this
<i>very</i> extraordinary case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bumpkin looked and blushed.&nbsp; He was not a liar, but truth
is not always the most convenient thing, say what you will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Mr. Prigg; &ldquo;quite
so&mdash;quite so!&nbsp; Now <i>how</i> did this
happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bumpkin still looked and blushed.</p>
<p><!-- page 257--><a name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
257</span>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Mr. Prigg; &ldquo;just so.&nbsp;
But who was this companion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bumpkin muttered &ldquo;A friend!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O! O! O!&rdquo; said Mr. Prigg, drawing a long face and
placing the fore-finger of his left hand perpendicularly from the
tip of his nose to the top of his forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noa,&rdquo; said Bumpkin, &ldquo;&rsquo;taint none
o&rsquo; that nuther; I beant a man o&rsquo; that
sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said Mr. Prigg, &ldquo;I only
thought I&rsquo;d call, you know, in case there should be
anything which might in any way affect our action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bumpkin, conscious of his moral rectitude, like all good
men, was fearless: he knew that nothing which he had done would
affect the merits of his case, and, therefore, instead of
replying to the subtle question of his adviser, he merely
enquired of that gentleman when he thought the case would be
on.&nbsp; The usual question.</p>
<p>Mr. Prigg rubbed his hands and glanced his eyes as though just
under his left elbow was a very deep well, at the bottom of which
lay that inestimable jewel, truth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Really,&rdquo;
Mr. Bumpkin, &ldquo;I expect every hour to see us in the
paper.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very extraordinary; they have no less
than three Courts sitting, as I daresay you are aware.&nbsp; No
less than&mdash;let me see, my mind&rsquo;s so full of business,
I have seven cases ready to come on.&nbsp; Where was I?&nbsp; O,
I know; I say there are no less than three Courts, under the
continuous sittings system, and yet we seem to make no progress
in the diminution of the tremendous and overwhelming mass of
business that pours in upon us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bumpkin said &ldquo;Hem!&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 258--><a name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
258</span>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; continued Mr. Prigg,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s one thing, we shall not last long when we do
come on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shan&rsquo;t ur?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see there&rsquo;s only one witness, besides
yourself, on our side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And &rsquo;eve gone for a soger,&rdquo; said Mr.
Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A soldier!&rdquo; exclaimed Prigg.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
soldier, my dear Bumpkin.&nbsp; No&mdash;no&mdash;you don&rsquo;t
say so, really!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, sure &rsquo;ave ur; and wot the devil I be to do
agin that there Snooks, as &rsquo;ll lie through a brick wall, I
beant able to say.&nbsp; I be pooty nigh off my chump wot
wi&rsquo; one thing and another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Off what, sir?&rdquo; enquired Mr. Prigg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chump,&rdquo; shouted Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, indeed, yes; dear me, you don&rsquo;t say so.&nbsp;
Well, now I&rsquo;m glad I called.&nbsp; I must see about
this.&nbsp; What regiment did you say he&rsquo;d
joined?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hoosors!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! dear me, has he, indeed?&rdquo; said Mr. Prigg,
noting it down in his pocket-book.&nbsp; &ldquo;What a pity for a
young man like that to throw himself away&mdash;such an
intelligent young fellow, too, and might have done so well; dear
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha,&rdquo; answered Bumpkin, &ldquo;there worn&rsquo;t
a better feller at plough nor thic there; and he could mend a
barrer or a &rsquo;arrer, and turn his &rsquo;and to pooty nigh
anything about t&rsquo; farm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is there any reason that can be assigned for this
extraordinary conduct?&nbsp; Wasn&rsquo;t in debt, I
suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bumpkin laughed one of his old big fireside laughs such as
he had not indulged in lately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Debt! why they wouldn&rsquo;t trust un a
shoe-string.&nbsp; <!-- page 259--><a name="page259"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 259</span>Where the devil wur such a chap as
thic to get money to get into debt wi&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear sir, we don&rsquo;t want money to get into debt
with; we get into debt when we have none.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do ur, sir.&nbsp; Then if I hadn&rsquo;t &rsquo;ad any
money I&rsquo;d like to know &rsquo;ow fur thee&rsquo;d ha&rsquo;
trusted I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; said Mr. Prigg, &ldquo;what a very
curious way of putting it!&nbsp; But, however, soldier or no
soldier, we must have his evidence.&nbsp; I must see about it: I
must go to the d&eacute;p&ocirc;t.&nbsp; Now, with regard to your
case at the Old Bailey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumpkin, rather testily; &ldquo;I
be bound over to proserkit, and that be all I knows about
un.&nbsp; I got to give seam evidence as I guv afore the Lord
Mayor, and the Lord Mayor said as the case wur clear, and away it
went for trial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed! dear me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I got to tak no trouble at all about un, but to
keep my mouth shut till the case comes on, that&rsquo;s what the
pleeceman told I.&nbsp; I bean&rsquo;t to talk about un, or to
tak any money not to proserkit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O dear, no,&rdquo; said Mr. Prigg.&nbsp; &ldquo;O dear,
dear, no; you would be compounding a felony.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Here
Mr. Prigg made a note in his diary to this
effect:&mdash;&ldquo;Attending you at &lsquo;The Goose&rsquo; at
Westminster, when you informed me that you were the prosecutor in
a case at the Old Bailey, and in which I advised you not, under
any circumstances, to accept a compromise or money for the
purpose of withdrawing from the prosecution, and strongly
impressed upon you that such conduct would amount in law to a
misdemeanor.&nbsp; Long conference with you thereon, when you
promised to abide by my advice, &pound;1 6<i>s.</i>
0<i>d.</i>&rdquo;).</p>
<p><!-- page 260--><a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
260</span>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Bumpkin, &ldquo;it seem to me
that turn which way I wool, there be too much law, too many
pitfalls; I be gettin&rsquo; sick on&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Prigg, &ldquo;we have only to do
our duty in that station of life in which we are called, and we
have no cause to fear.&nbsp; Now you know you would <i>not</i>
have liked that unprincipled man, Snooks, to have the laugh of
you, would you now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bumpkin clenched his fist as he said, &ldquo;Noa,
I&rsquo;d sooner lose every penny I got than thic there feller
should ha&rsquo; the grin o&rsquo; me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; said the straightforward
moralist.&nbsp; &ldquo;Quite so! dear me!&nbsp; Well, well, I
must wish you good morning, for really I am so overwhelmed with
work that I hardly know which way to turn&mdash;bye, bye.&nbsp; I
will take care to keep you posted up in&mdash;.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here
Mr. Prigg&rsquo;s cab drove off, and I could not ascertain
whether the posting up was to be in the state of the list or in
the lawyer&rsquo;s ledger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a nice man!&rdquo; said the landlady.</p>
<p>Yes, that was Mr. Prigg&rsquo;s character, go where he would:
&ldquo;A nice man!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="gutsumm">The trial at the Old Bailey of Mr. Simple
Simonman for highway robbery with violence&mdash;Mr. Alibi
introduces himself to Mr. Bumpkin.</p>
<p>I next saw Mr. Bumpkin wandering about the precincts of that
Grand Institution, the Old Bailey, on a drizzly morning about the
middle of February, 187&mdash;, waiting to go before the Grand
Jury.&nbsp; As the famous prison in Scotland was called the
&ldquo;Heart of Midlothian&rdquo; so the Old Bailey may be
considered the Heart of Civilization.&nbsp; Its commanding
situation, in the very centre of a commercial population,
entitles it to this distinction; for nothing is supposed to have
so civilizing an influence as Commerce.&nbsp; I was always
impressed with its beautiful and picturesque appearance,
especially on a fine summer morning, during its sittings, when
the sun was pouring its brightest beams on its lively
portals.&nbsp; What a charming picture was presented to your
view, when the gates being open, the range of sheds on the left
met the eye, especially the centre one where the gallows is kept
packed up for future use.&nbsp; The gallows on the one side might
be seen and the stately carriages of my Lord Mayor and Sheriffs
on the other!&nbsp; Gorgeous coachmen and footmen in resplendent
liveries; magnificent civic dignitaries in elaborate liveries
too, rich with gold and bright with <!-- page 262--><a
name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 262</span>colour,
stepping forth from their carriages, amid loud cries of
&ldquo;Make way!&rdquo; holding in their white-gloved hands large
bouquets of the loveliest flowers, emblems of&mdash;what?</p>
<p>Crime truly has its magnificent accompaniments, and if it does
not dress itself, as of old, in the rich costumes of a Turpin or
a Duval, it is not without its beautiful surroundings.&nbsp;
Here, where the channels and gutters of crime converge, is built,
in the centre of the greatest commercial city in the world, the
Bailey.&nbsp; Mr. Bumpkin wandered about for hours through a
reeking unsavoury crowd of thieves and thieves&rsquo; companions,
idlers of every type of blackguardism, ruffians of every degree
of criminality; boys and girls receiving their finishing lessons
in crime under the dock, as they used to do only a few years ago
under the gallows.&nbsp; The public street is given over to the
enemies of Society; and Civilisation looks on without a shudder
or regret, as though crime were a necessity, and the Old Bailey,
in the heart of London, no disgrace.</p>
<p>And a little dirty, greasy hatted, black whiskered man, after
pushing hither and thither through this pestiferous crowd as
though he had business with everybody, but did not exactly know
what it was, at length approached Mr. Bumpkin; and after standing
a few minutes by his side eyeing him with keen hungry looks,
began that interesting conversation about the weather which seems
always so universally acceptable.&nbsp; Mr. Bumpkin was
tired.&nbsp; He had been wandering for hours in the street, and
was wondering when he should be called before the Grand
Jury.&nbsp; Mr. Alibi, that was the dark gentleman&rsquo;s name,
knew all about Mr. Bumpkin&rsquo;s case, his condition of mind,
and his impatience; and he said deferentially:</p>
<p><!-- page 263--><a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
263</span>&ldquo;You are waiting to go before the Grand Jury, I
suppose, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I be,&rdquo; answered Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your policeman?&rdquo; enquired
Alibi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doant know,&rdquo; said Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s his number?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sev&rsquo;n hunderd and sev&rsquo;nty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, I know,&rdquo; said Alibi; &ldquo;why not let me get
you before the Grand Jury at once, instead of waiting about here
all day, and perhaps to-morrow and the next day, and the day
after that; besides, the sooner you go before the Grand Jury, the
sooner your case will come on; that stands to common sense, I
think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So ur do,&rdquo; answered the farmer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will be here a month if you don&rsquo;t look
out.&nbsp; Have you got any counsel or solicitor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noa, I beant; my case be that plaain, it spaks for
itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Mr. Alibi; &ldquo;they won&rsquo;t
always let a case speak for itself&mdash;they very often stop
it&mdash;but if you can get a counsel for nothing, why not have
one; that stands to reason, I think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For nothing? well that be the fust time I ever eeard
o&rsquo; a loryer as chape as thic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How it could pay was the wonder to Mr. Bumpkin.&nbsp; And what
a strange delusion it must seem to the mind of the general
reader!&nbsp; But wait, gentle peruser of this history, you shall
see this strange sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you like to have a counsel and a lawyer to conduct
your case, sir, it shall not cost you a farthing, I give you my
word of honour!&nbsp; What do you think of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>What could Mr. Bumpkin think of that?&nbsp; What a pity that
he had not met this gentleman before!&nbsp; Probably he <!-- page
264--><a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
264</span>would have brought several actions if he had; for if
you could work the machinery of the law for nothing, you would
always stand to win.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O,&rdquo; said Mr. Alibi, &ldquo;here is seven hundred
and seventy!&nbsp; This gentleman wants a counsel, and I&rsquo;ve
been telling him he can have one, and it won&rsquo;t cost him
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right enough,&rdquo; said the Policeman;
&ldquo;but it ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; to do with me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just step this way, sir, we&rsquo;ll soon have this
case on,&rdquo; said Alibi; and he led the way to the back room
of a public-house, which seemed to be used as a
&ldquo;hedge&rdquo; lawyer&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Med I mak so bold, sir; be thee a loryer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Alibi, &ldquo;I am clerk to Mr.
Deadandgone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t Mr. Deadandam charge
nothin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O dear, no!&rdquo;</p>
<p>What a very nice man Mr. Deadandam must be!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Alibi, &ldquo;the Crown pays
us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Crown!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And here Mr. Alibi slipped a crown-piece into the artfully
extended palm of the policeman, who said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; to do wi&rsquo; me; but
the gentleman&rsquo;s quite right, the Crown pays.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And he dropped the money into his leather purse, which he rolled
up carefully and placed in his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Alibi, &ldquo;I act as the Public
Prosecutor, who can&rsquo;t be expected to do
everything&mdash;you can&rsquo;t grind all the wheat in the
country in one mill, that stands to common sense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That be right, that&rsquo;s werry good,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; continued Mr. Alibi, &ldquo;the Government

265</span>allows two guineas for counsel, a guinea for the
solicitor, and so on, and the witnesses, don&rsquo;t you
see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zactly!&rdquo; said Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s quite enough,&rdquo; continued Alibi;
&ldquo;we don&rsquo;t want anything from the
prosecutor&mdash;that&rsquo;s right, policeman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t nothink to do wi&rsquo; me,&rdquo; said
the policeman; &ldquo;but what this &rsquo;ere gentleman says is
the law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said Alibi, &ldquo;I told you
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I spose,&rdquo; said the policeman, &ldquo;you
don&rsquo;t want me, gentlemen; it ain&rsquo;t nothink to do with
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Leary,&rdquo; replied Alibi; &ldquo;we
don&rsquo;t want you; the case is pretty straight, I
suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, sir; I expects it&rsquo;ll be a plea of
guilty.&nbsp; There ain&rsquo;t no defence, not as I&rsquo;m
aware of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Alibi, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s all
right&mdash;keep your witnesses together, Leary&mdash;don&rsquo;t
be out of the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; says Leary; &ldquo;I thinks I knows my
dooty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with this he slouched out of the room, and went and
refreshed himself at the bar.</p>
<p>In two or three minutes the policeman returned, and was in the
act of drawing the back of his hand across his mouth, when Alibi
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beg pardin, sir; but there&rsquo;s another gentleman
wants to see you&mdash;I thinks he wants you to defend ---; but
it ain&rsquo;t nothink to do wi&rsquo; me, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; answered Alibi, &ldquo;very good; now
let me see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got the Baker&rsquo;s case?&rdquo; said Leary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Alibi; &ldquo;O,
yes&mdash;embezzlement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everything was thus far satisfactorily settled, and Mr. <!--
page 266--><a name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
266</span>Bumpkin&rsquo;s interests duly represented by Mr.
Deadandgone, an eminent practitioner.&nbsp; No doubt the services
of competent counsel would be procured, and the case fully
presented to the consideration of an intelligent jury.</p>
<p>Who shall say after this that the Old Bailey is <i>not</i> the
Heart of Civilization?</p>
<p>I pass over the preliminary canter of Mr. Bumpkin before the
Grand Jury; the decision of that judicial body, the finding of
the true bill, the return of the said bill in Court, the bringing
up of the prisoner for arraignment, and the fixing of the case to
be taken first on Thursday in deference to the wishes of Mr.
Nimble.&nbsp; I pass by all those preliminary proceedings which I
have before attempted to describe, and which, if I might employ a
racing simile, might be compared to the saddling of Mr. Bumpkin
in the paddock, where, unquestionably, he was first favourite for
the coming race, to be ridden by that excellent jockey, Alibi;
and come at once to the great and memorable trial of Regina on
the prosecution of Thomas Bumpkin against Simon Simpleman for
highway robbery with violence.</p>
<p>As the prisoner entered the dock there was a look of
unaffected innocence in his appearance that seemed to make an
impression on the learned Judge, Mr. Justice Technical, a
recently appointed Chancery barrister.&nbsp; I may be allowed to
mention that his Lordship had never had any experience in
Criminal Courts whatever: so he brought to the discharge of his
important duty a thoroughly unprejudiced and impartial
mind.&nbsp; He did not suspect that a man was guilty because he
was charged: and the respectable and harmless manner of the
accused was not interpreted by his Lordship as a piece of
consummate acting, as it would be by some Judges <!-- page
267--><a name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
267</span>who have seen much of the world as it is exhibited in
Criminal Courts.</p>
<p>Many ladies of rank were ushered in by the Sheriff, all
looking as smiling and happy as if they were about to witness the
performance of some celebrated actress for the first time; they
had fans and opera-glasses, and as they took their places in the
boxes allotted to rank and fashion, there was quite a pleasant
sensation produced in Court, and they attracted more notice for
the time being than the prisoners themselves.</p>
<p>Now these ladies were not there to witness the first piece,
the mere trial of Simpleman for highway robbery, although the
sentence might include the necessary brutality of flogging.&nbsp;
The afterpiece was what they had come to see&mdash;namely, a
fearful tragedy, in which two men at least were sure of being
sentenced to death.&nbsp; This is the nearest approach to
shedding human blood which ladies can now witness in this
country; for I do not regard pigeon slaughtering, brutal and
bloodthirsty as it is, as comparable to the sentencing of a
fellow-creature to be strangled.&nbsp; And no one can blame
ladies of rank if they slake their thirst for horrors in the only
way the law now leaves open to them.&nbsp; The Beauty of Spain is
better provided for.&nbsp; What a blessed thing is humanity!</p>
<p>It is due to Mr. Newboy, the counsel for the prosecution in
the great case of <i>Regina</i> v. <i>Simpleman</i>, to say that
he had only lately been called to the Bar, and only
&ldquo;<i>instructed</i>,&rdquo; as the prisoner was placed in
the dock.&nbsp; Consequently, he had not had time to read his
brief.&nbsp; I do not know that that was a disadvantage, inasmuch
as the brief consisted in what purported to be a copy of the
depositions so illegibly scrawled that it would have <!-- page
268--><a name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
268</span>required the most intense study to make out the meaning
of a single line.</p>
<p>Mr. Newboy was by no means devoid of ability; but no amount of
ability would give a man a knowledge of the facts of a case which
were never communicated to him.&nbsp; In its simplicity the
prosecution was beautifully commonplace, and five minutes&rsquo;
consideration would have been sufficient to enable counsel to
master the details and be prepared to meet the defence.&nbsp;
Alas, for the lack of those five minutes!&nbsp; The more Mr.
Newboy looked at the writing (?) the more confused he got.&nbsp;
All he could make out was his own name, and <i>Reg.</i> v.
<i>Somebody</i> on the back.</p>
<p>Now it happened that Mr. Alibi saw the difficulty in which Mr.
Newboy was, and knowing that his, Alibi&rsquo;s, clerk, was not
remarkable for penmanship, handed to the learned counsel at the
last moment, when the last juryman was being bawled at with the
&ldquo;well and truly try,&rdquo; a copy of the depositions.</p>
<p>The first name at the top of the first page which caught the
eye of the learned counsel, was that of the prisoner; for the
depositions commence in such a way as to show the name of the
prisoner in close proximity to, if not among the names of
witnesses.</p>
<p>So Mr. Newboy, in his confusion, taking the name of the
prisoner as his first witness, shouted out in a bold voice, to
give himself courage, &ldquo;<i>Simon Simpleman</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ere!&rdquo; answered the prisoner.</p>
<p>The learned Judge was a little astonished; and, although, he
had got his criminal law up with remarkable rapidity, his
lordship knew well enough that you cannot call the prisoner as a
witness either for or against himself.&nbsp; Mr. Newboy perceived
his mistake and apologised.&nbsp; <!-- page 269--><a
name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 269</span>The laugh,
of course, went round against him; and when it got to Mr. Nimble,
that merry gentleman slid it into the jury-box with a turn of his
eyes and a twist of his mouth.&nbsp; The counsel for the
prosecution being by this time pretty considerably confused, and
not being able to make out the name of a single witness on the
depositions (there were only two) called out, &ldquo;The
Prosecutor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, I be,&rdquo; said a voice from the crowd in a
tone which provoked more laughter, all of which was turned into
the jury-box by Mr. Nimble.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here I be&rdquo;
struggled manfully with all his might and main to push through
the miscellaneous crowd of all sorts and conditions that hemmed
him in.&nbsp; All the arrangements at the Old Bailey, like the
arrangements at most Courts, are expressly devised for the
inconvenience of those who have business there.</p>
<p>All eyes were turned towards &ldquo;<i>Here I be</i>,&rdquo;
as, after much pushing and struggling as though he were in a
football match, he was thrust headlong forward by three policemen
and the crier into the body of the Court.&nbsp; There he stood
utterly confounded by the treatment he had undergone and the
sight that presented itself to his astonished gaze.&nbsp;
Opera-glasses were turned on him from the boxes, the gentlemen on
the grand tier strained their necks in order to catch a glimpse
of him; the pit, filled for the most part with young barristers,
was in suppressed ecstasies; while the gallery, packed to the
utmost limit of its capacity, broke out into unrestrained
laughter.&nbsp; I say, unrestrained; but as the Press truly
observed in the evening papers, &ldquo;it was immediately
suppressed by the Usher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bumpkin climbed into the witness-box (as though <!-- page
270--><a name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 270</span>he
were going up a rick), which was situated between the Judge and
the jury.&nbsp; His appearance again provoked a titter through
the Court; but it was not loud enough to call for any further
measure of suppression than the usual
&ldquo;Si&mdash;lence!&rdquo; loudly articulated in two widely
separated syllables by the crier, who had no sooner pronounced it
than he turned his face from the learned Judge and pressed his
hand tightly against his mouth, straining his eyes as if he had
swallowed a crown-piece.&nbsp; Mr. Bumpkin wore his long drab
frock overcoat, with the waist high up and its large flaps; his
hell-fire waistcoat, his trousers of corduroy, and his
shirt-collar, got up expressly for the occasion as though he had
been a prime minister.&nbsp; The ends of his neckerchief bore no
inconsiderable likeness to two well-grown carrots.&nbsp; In his
two hands he carefully nursed his large-brimmed well-shaped white
beaver hat; a useful article to hold in one&rsquo;s hands when
there is any danger of nervousness, for nothing is so hard to get
rid of as one&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; I am not sure that Mr. Bumpkin
was nervous.&nbsp; He was a brave self-contained man, who had
fought the world and conquered.&nbsp; His maxim was, &ldquo;right
is right,&rdquo; and &ldquo;wrong is no man&rsquo;s
right.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was of the upright and down-straight
character, and didn&rsquo;t care &ldquo;for all the counsellors
in the kingdom.&rdquo;&nbsp; And why should he?&nbsp; His cause
was good, his conscience clear, and the story he had to tell
plain and &ldquo;straightforrard&rdquo; as himself.&nbsp; No
wonder then that his face beamed with a good old country smile,
such as he would wear at an exhibition where he could show the
largest &ldquo;turmut as ever wur growed.&rdquo;&nbsp; That was
the sort of smile he turned upon the audience.&nbsp; And as the
audience looked at the &ldquo;turmut,&rdquo; it felt that it was
indeed the most extraordinary <!-- page 271--><a
name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 271</span>specimen of
field culture it had ever beheld, and worthy of the first
prize.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Newboy; &ldquo;I
mustn&rsquo;t lead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bumpkin, and I bearned asheamed on &rsquo;im,&rdquo;
answered the bold farmer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind whether you are ashamed or not,&rdquo;
interposed Mr. Nimble; &ldquo;just answer the
question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must answer,&rdquo; remarked the learned Judge,
&ldquo;not make a speech.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zackly, sir,&rdquo; said Bumpkin, pulling at his
hair.</p>
<p>Another titter.&nbsp; The jury titter and hold down their
heads.&nbsp; Evidently there&rsquo;s fun in the case.</p>
<p>Then Mr. Newboy questioned him about the occurrence; asked him
if he recollected such a day, and where he had been, and where he
was going, and a variety of other questions; the answer to every
one of which provoked fresh laughter; until, after much
floundering on the part of both himself and Mr. Newboy, as though
they were engaged in a wrestling match, he was asked by the
learned Judge &ldquo;to tell them exactly what happened.&nbsp;
Let him tell his own story,&rdquo; said the Judge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said everybody; &ldquo;now we shall hear
something!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wur a gwine,&rdquo; began Bumpkin,
&ldquo;hoame&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not evidence,&rdquo; said Mr. Nimble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo; asks the Judge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter where he was going to, my lord,
but where he was!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that is so,&rdquo; says the Judge; &ldquo;you
mustn&rsquo;t tell us, Mr. Bumpkin, whither you were going, but
where you were!&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 272--><a name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
272</span>Bumpkin scratched his head; there were too many
where&rsquo;s for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t yon tell us,&rdquo; says Mr. Newboy,
&ldquo;where you were?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where I were?&rdquo; says Bumpkin.</p>
<p>A roar of laughter greeted this statement.&nbsp; Mr. Nimble
turning it into the jury-box like a flood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wur in Lunnun&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes,&rdquo; says his counsel; &ldquo;but what
locality?&rdquo;</p>
<p>You might just as well have put him under a mangle, as to try
to get evidence out of him like that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; says the Judge, &ldquo;attend to me; if
you go on like that, you will not be allowed your
expenses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What took place?&rdquo; asks his counsel;
&ldquo;can&rsquo;t you tell us, man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why the thief cotch&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I object,&rdquo; says Mr. Nimble; &ldquo;you
mustn&rsquo;t call him a thief; it is for the jury, my lord, to
determine that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is so,&rdquo; says my lord; &ldquo;you
mustn&rsquo;t call him a thief, Mr. Bumpkin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beg pardon, your lord; but ur stole my
watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no,&rdquo; says Mr. Newboy; &ldquo;took your
watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An if ur took un, ur stole un, I allows,&rdquo; says
Bumpkin; &ldquo;for I never gin it to un.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was so much laughter that for some time nothing further
was said; but every audience knows better than to check the
source of merriment by a continued uproar; so it waited for
another supply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must confine yourself,&rdquo; says the Judge,
&ldquo;to telling us what took place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll spak truth and sheam t&rsquo; devil,&rdquo;
says Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now go on,&rdquo; says Newboy.</p>
<p><!-- page 273--><a name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
273</span>&ldquo;The thief stole my watch, and that be t&rsquo;
plain English on &rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall have to commit you to prison,&rdquo; says the
Judge, &ldquo;if you go on like that; remember you are upon your
oath, and it&rsquo;s a very serious thing&mdash;serious for you
and serious for the young man at the bar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these touching words, the young man at the bar burst out
crying, said &ldquo;he was a respectable man, and it was all got
up against him;&rdquo; whereupon Mr. Nimble said &ldquo;he must
be quiet, and that his lordship and the gentlemen in the box
would take care of him and not allow him to be trampled
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are liable,&rdquo; said the Judge, &ldquo;to be
prosecuted for perjury if you do not tell the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, your lord, if a man maun goo to prison for
losin&rsquo; his watch, I&rsquo;ll goo that&rsquo;s all; but that
ere man stole un.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Newboy: &ldquo;He took it, did he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I object,&rdquo; said Mr. Nimble; &ldquo;that is a
leading question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Judge; &ldquo;I think that is
rather leading,&rdquo; Mr. Newboy; &ldquo;you may vary the form
though, and ask him whether the prisoner stole it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, my lord,&rdquo; said Mr. Nimble, &ldquo;that,
with very great respect, is as leading as the other
form.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite, I think, Mr. Nimble.&nbsp; You see in the
other form, you make a positive assertion that he did steal it;
in this, you merely ask the question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I saw that this was a very keen and subtle distinction,
such as could only be drawn by a Chancery Judge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would it not be better, my lord, if he told us what
took place?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 274--><a name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
274</span>&ldquo;That is what he is doing,&rdquo; said the Judge;
&ldquo;go on, witness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say as &rsquo;ow thic feller comed out and hugged up
aginst I and took &rsquo;t watch and runned away.&nbsp; I
arter&rsquo;d him, and met him coomin&rsquo; along wi&rsquo; it
in &rsquo;s pocket; what can be plaainer an thic?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was great laughter as Mr. Bumpkin shook his head at the
learned counsel for the defence, and thumped one hand upon the
ledge in front of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; said Mr. Newboy, sitting down
triumphantly.</p>
<p>Then the counsel for the defence arose, and a titter again
went round the Court, and there was a very audible adjustment of
persons in preparation for the treat that was to come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May the prisoner have a seat, my lord?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, certainly,&rdquo; said his lordship; &ldquo;let an
easy-chair be brought immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, Mr. Bumpkin, or whatever your name is,
don&rsquo;t lounge on the desk like that, but just stand up and
attend to me.&nbsp; Stand up, sir, and answer my
questions,&rdquo; says Mr. Nimble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I be standin&rsquo; oop,&rdquo; said Bumpkin,
&ldquo;and I can answer thee; ax away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just attend,&rdquo; said the Judge.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
must not go on like that.&nbsp; You are here to answer questions
and not to make speeches.&nbsp; If you wish those gentlemen to
believe you, you must conduct yourself in a proper manner.&nbsp;
Remember this is a serious charge, and you are upon your
oath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Bumpkin!&nbsp; Never was there a more friendless position
than that of Ignorance in the witness-box.</p>
<p><!-- page 275--><a name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
275</span>&ldquo;Just attend!&rdquo; repeated Mr. Nimble; this
was a favourite expression of his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How may aliases have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ow many who?&rdquo; asked Bumpkin.&nbsp; (Roars of
laughter.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many different names?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naames! why I s&rsquo;pose I got two, like moast
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None as iver I knowed of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a bit, we shall see.&nbsp; Now, sir, will you
swear you have never gone by the name of Pumpkin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Loud laughter, in which the learned judge tried not to
join.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you swear it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lord, would you kindly let me see the
depositions.&nbsp; Now look here, sir, is that your
signature?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t much of a scollard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; but you can make a cross, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, I can make a cross, or zummut in imitation as well
as any man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at that, is that your cross?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It look like un.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, sir; when you were before the Lord Mayor, I
ask you, upon your oath, did you not give the name of
Pumpkin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noa, I din&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was this read over to you, and were you asked if it was
correct?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It med be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Med be; but wasn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; You know it was, or,
don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 276--><a name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
276</span>Bumpkin seemed spiked, so silent; seemed on fire, so
red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we know it was so.&nbsp; Now, my lord, I call
your lordship&rsquo;s attention to this remarkable fact; here in
the depositions he calls himself Pumpkin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His lordship looks carefully at the depositions and says that
certainly is so.</p>
<p>Mr. Newboy rises and says he understands that it may be a
mistake of the clerk&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Judge: &ldquo;How can you say that, Mr. Newboy, when
it&rsquo;s in his affidavit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Clerk of Arraigns whispers to his lordship.)&nbsp; &ldquo;I
mean in his depositions, as I am told they are called in this
Court; these are read over to him by the clerk, and he is asked
if they are correct.&rdquo;&nbsp; Shakes his head.</p>
<p>(So they began to try the prisoner, not so much on the merits
of the case as on the merits of the magistrate&rsquo;s
clerk.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly said your name was Pumpkin,&rdquo; said
the Judge, &ldquo;and what is more you swore to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got the round square at work,&rdquo;
muttered a voice in the gallery.)</p>
<p>Mr. Nimble: &ldquo;Now just attend; have you ever gone so far
as to say that this case did not refer to you because your name
was not Bumpkin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The witness hesitates, then says &ldquo;he b&rsquo;leeves
not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let those two gentlemen, Mr. Crackcrib and Mr.
Centrebit, step forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a bustle in Court, and then, with grinning faces, up
stepped the two men who had visited Mr. Bumpkin at the
&ldquo;Goose&rdquo; some days before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever seen these gentlemen before?&rdquo; asks
the learned counsel.</p>
<p>The gentlemen alluded to looked up as if they had <!-- page
277--><a name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
277</span>practised it together, and both grinned.&nbsp; How can
Mr. Bumpkin&rsquo;s confusion be described?&nbsp; His under jaw
fell, and his head drooped; he was like one caught in a net
looking at the fowler.</p>
<p>The question was repeated, and Mr. Bumpkin wiped his face and
returned his handkerchief into the depths of his hat, into which
he would have liked to plunge also.</p>
<p>Question repeated in a tone that conveyed the impression that
witness was one of the biggest scoundrels in the Heart of
Civilization.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must really answer,&rdquo; says the Judge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They be put on, your lordship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; says the counsel, &ldquo;you
mustn&rsquo;t say that, I&rsquo;ll have an answer.&nbsp; Have you
seen them before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; muttered the prosecutor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them go out of Court.&nbsp; Now then,&rdquo; says
the counsel, extending his right hand and his forefinger and
leaning towards the witness,
&ldquo;have&mdash;you&mdash;not&mdash;told&mdash;them&mdash;that&mdash;this
case was nothing to do with you as your name wasn&rsquo;t
Bumpkin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; says the witness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no; you must answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The witness stood confounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You decline to answer,&rdquo; says the counsel.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Very well; now then, let me see if you will decline to
answer this.&nbsp; When you were robbed, as you say, was anybody
with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be I obligated to answer, my lord?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you must answer,&rdquo; said his lordship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There wur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A companion, I s&rsquo;poase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but who was he? what was his name?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 278--><a name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
278</span>No answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d rather not answer; very well.&nbsp; Where
does he live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doant know.&nbsp; Westmunster, I believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not as I knows on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(&ldquo;What a lark this is,&rdquo; chuckled the Don, as he
sat in the corner of the gallery peeping from behind the front
row.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he see the watch taken?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did, leastways I s&rsquo;poase so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And has never appeared as a witness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is that?&rdquo; asks his lordship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He axed me, m&rsquo;lud, not to say as &rsquo;ow he wur
in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judge shakes his head.&nbsp; Counsel for the prisoner shakes
his head at the jury, and the jury shake their heads at one
another.</p>
<p>Now in the front row of the gallery sat five young men in the
undress uniform of the hussars: they were Joe and his brother
recruits come to hear the famous trial.&nbsp; At this moment Mr.
Bumpkin in sheer despair lifted his eyes in the direction of the
gallery and immediately caught sight of his old servant.&nbsp; He
gave a nod of recognition as if he were the only friend left in
the wide world of that Court of Justice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind your friends in the gallery,&rdquo; said Mr.
Nimble; &ldquo;I dare say you have plenty of them about; now
attend to this question:&rdquo;&mdash;Yes, and a nice question it
was, considering the tone and manner with which it was
asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;At the moment when you were being robbed, as
you say, did a young woman with a baby in her arms come
up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The witness&rsquo;s attention was again distracted, but this

279</span>time by no such pleasing object as on the former
occasion.&nbsp; He was dumbfoundered; a sparrow facing an owl
could hardly be in a greater state of nervousness and
discomfiture: for down in the well of the Court, a place where he
had never once cast his eyes till now, with a broad grin on his
coarse features, and a look of malignant triumph, sat the
<i>fiendlike Snooks</i>!&nbsp; His mouth was wide open, and
Bumpkin found himself looking down into it as though it had been
a saw-pit.&nbsp; By his side sat Locust taking notes of the
cross-examination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you looking at, Mr. Bumpkin?&rdquo; inquired
the learned counsel.</p>
<p>Mr. Bumpkin started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you looking at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wur lookin&rsquo; doun thic there hole in thic
feller&rsquo;s head,&rdquo; answered Bumpkin.</p>
<p>Such a roar of laughter followed this speech as is seldom
heard even in a breach of promise case, where the most touching
pathos often causes the greatest amusement to the audience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a lark!&rdquo; said Harry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As good as a play,&rdquo; responded Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I be sorry for the old chap,&rdquo; said Joe;
&ldquo;they be givin&rsquo; it to un pooty stiff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now attend,&rdquo; said the counsel, &ldquo;and never
mind the hole.&nbsp; Did a young woman with a baby come
up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the best o&rsquo; my b&rsquo;leef.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say to the best of your belief; did she or
not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can only speak to the best of his belief,&rdquo;
said the Judge.</p>
<p>(&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the round square,&rdquo; whispered
O&rsquo;Rapley.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she come up then to the best of your
belief?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 280--><a name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
280</span>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;did&mdash;she&mdash;accuse&mdash;you&mdash;to
the best of your belief of assaulting her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I be a married man,&rdquo; answered the witness.&nbsp;
(Great laughter.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we know all about you; we&rsquo;ll see who you are
presently.&nbsp; Did she accuse you, and did you run
away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I runned arter thic feller.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no; did she accuse you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She might.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The learned counsel then sat down with the quickest motion
imaginable, and then the policeman gave his evidence as to taking
the man into custody; and produced the huge watch.&nbsp; Mr.
Bumpkin was recalled and asked how long he had had it, and where
he bought it; the only answers to which were that he had had it
five years, and bought it of a man in the market; did not know
who he was or where he came from; all which answers looked very
black against Mr. Bumpkin.&nbsp; Then the policeman was asked to
answer this question&mdash;yes or no.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did he know
the prisoner?&rdquo;&nbsp; He said &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Nimble said to the jury, &ldquo;Here was a man dressing
himself up as an old man from the country (laughter) prowling
about the streets of London in company with an associate whose
name he dared not mention, and who probably was well-known to the
police; here was this countryman actually accused of committing
an assault in the public streets on a young woman with a baby in
her arms: he runs away as hard as his legs will carry him and
meets a man who is actually wearing the watch that this Bumpkin
or Pumpkin charges him with stealing.&nbsp; He, the learned
counsel, would call witness after witness <!-- page 281--><a
name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 281</span>to speak to
the character of his client, who was an engraver (I believe he
was an engraver of bank notes); he would call witness after
witness who would tell them how long they had known him, and how
long he had had the watch; and, curiously enough, such curious
things did sometimes almost providentially take place in a Court
of Justice, he would call the very man that poor Mr. Simpleman
had purchased it of five years ago, when he was almost, as you
might say, in the first happy blush of boyhood (that &lsquo;blush
of boyhood&rsquo; went down with many of the jury who were fond
of pathos); let the jury only fancy! but really would it be
safe&mdash;really would it be safe, let him ask them upon their
consciences, which in after life, perhaps years to come, when
their heads were on their pillows, and their hands upon their
hearts, (here several of the jury audibly sniffed), would those
consciences upbraid, or would those consciences approve them for
their work to-day? would it be safe to convict after the
exhibition the prosecutor had made of himself in that box, where,
he ventured to say, Bumpkin stood self-condemned before that
intelligent jury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the intelligent jury turned towards one another, and
after a moment or two announced, through their foreman (who was a
general-dealer in old metal, in a dark street over the water),
that if they heard a witness or two to the young man&rsquo;s
character that would be enough for them.</p>
<p>Witnesses, therefore, were called to character, and the young
man was promptly acquitted, the jury appending to their verdict
that he left the Court without a stain upon his character.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bean&rsquo;t I &rsquo;lowed to call witnesses to
charickter?&rdquo; asks the Prosecutor.</p>
<p><!-- page 282--><a name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
282</span>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; replied Mr. Nimble; &ldquo;we
know your character pretty well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; inquired the Judge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wants to know, my lord,&rdquo; says Mr. Nimble,
laughing, &ldquo;if he may call witnesses to
character!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear, no,&rdquo; says the Judge; &ldquo;you were not
being tried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now many persons might have been of a different opinion from
his lordship on this point.&nbsp; Snooks for one, I think; for he
gave a great loud vulgar haw! haw! haw! and said, &ldquo;I could
ha&rsquo; gien him a charakter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Si-lence!&rdquo; said the Usher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May the prisoner have his watch, my lord?&rdquo; asks
Mr. Nimble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, yes,&rdquo; said his lordship, &ldquo;to be
sure.&nbsp; Give the prisoner his watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>His</i> watch,&rdquo; groaned a voice.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">Mr. Alibi is stricken with a
thunderbolt&mdash;interview with Horatio and Mr. Prigg.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;round square,&rdquo; as the facetious Don called
the new style of putting the round judicial pegs into the square
judicial holes, had indeed been applied with great effect on this
occasion; for I perceived that Mr. Alibi, remarkable man, was not
only engaged on the part of the Crown to prosecute, but also on
that of the prisoner to defend.&nbsp; And this fact came to my
knowledge in the manner following:</p>
<p>When Mr. Bumpkin got into the lower part of that magnificent
pile of buildings which we have agreed to call the Heart of
Civilisation, he soon became the centre of a dirty mob of
undersized beings who were anxious to obtain a sight of him; and
many of whom were waiting to congratulate their friend, the
engraver.&nbsp; Amidst the crowd was Mr. Alibi.&nbsp; That
gentleman had no intention of meeting Mr. Bumpkin any more, for
certain expenses were due to him as a witness, and it had long
been a custom at the Old Bailey, that if the representative of
the Crown did not see the witnesses the expenses due to them
would fall into the Consolidated Fund, so that it was a clear
gain to the State if its representative officers did not meet the
witnesses.&nbsp; On this occasion, however, Mr. Alibi ran against
his client <!-- page 284--><a name="page284"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 284</span>accidentally, and being a courteous
gentleman, could not forbear condoling with him on the
unsuccessful termination of his case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, see,&rdquo; began Mr. Alibi, &ldquo;I was
instructed so late&mdash;really, the wonder is, when gentlemen
don&rsquo;t employ a solicitor till the last moment, how we ever
lay hold of the facts at all.&nbsp; Now look at your case,
sir.&nbsp; Yes, yes, I&rsquo;m coming&mdash;bother my clerks, how
they worry&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be there directly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But thic feller,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumpkin, &ldquo;who
had my case din&rsquo;t know nowt about it.&nbsp; I could
ha&rsquo; done un better mysel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, sir; so we are all apt to think.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a
most clever man, that&mdash;a very rising man, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be he?&rdquo; said Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, do you know, sir,&rdquo; continued Mr. Alibi,
&ldquo;he was very great at his University.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That bean&rsquo;t everything, though, by a long
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, granted, granted.&nbsp; But he was Number Four
in his boat; and the papers all said his feathering was
beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good boatman, wur he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Magnificent, sir; magnificent!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he&rsquo;d better keep a ferry; bean&rsquo;t no
good at law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! I am afraid you are a little prejudiced.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s a very learned man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish he&rsquo;d larned to open his mouth.&nbsp; Why,
I got a duck can quack a devilish sight better un thic feller can
talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, how d&rsquo;ye do, Mr. Swindle?&rdquo; said a
shabby-looking gentleman, who came up at this moment.</p>
<p><!-- page 285--><a name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
285</span>&ldquo;Excuse me, sir; but you have the advantage of
me,&rdquo; said Alibi, winking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me, how very strange, I thought you were Mr.
Wideawake&rsquo;s representative.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Mr. Alibi, laughing, &ldquo;we are
often taken for brothers&mdash;and yet, would you believe me,
there is no relationship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo; said the gentleman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None, whatever.&nbsp; I think you&rsquo;ll find him in
the Second Court, if not, he&rsquo;ll be there in a short
time.&nbsp; I saw him only just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That is how I learned that Mr. Alibi represented the Crown and
Mr. Deadandgone for the prosecutor; also the prisoner, and Mr.
Wideawake for the defence.&nbsp; Clever man!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumpkin, &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t un get
a new trial?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear not,&rdquo; said Alibi; &ldquo;but I should not
be in the least surprised if that Wideawake, who represented the
prisoner, brought an action against you for false imprisonment
and malicious prosecution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, thic thief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, sir&mdash;law is a very deep pit&mdash;it&rsquo;s
depth is not to be measured by any moral plummet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doan&rsquo;t &rsquo;zacly zee&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s this,&rdquo; said Mr. Alibi.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Whether you&rsquo;re right or whether you&rsquo;re wrong,
if he brings an action you must defend it&mdash;it&rsquo;s not
your being in the right will save you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, what wool?&rdquo; asked Mr. Bumpkin.</p>
<p>Mr. Alibi did not know, unless it was instructing him in due
time and not leaving it to the last moment.&nbsp; That seemed the
only safe course.</p>
<p><!-- page 286--><a name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
286</span>Mr. Bumpkin took off his hat, drew out his
handkerchief, and wiped the perspiration from his forehead.&nbsp;
Then he breathed heavily.&nbsp; Now at this moment a strange
phenomenon occurred, not to be passed over in this truthful
history.&nbsp; Past Mr. Bumpkin&rsquo;s ear something shot, in
appearance like a human fist, in velocity like a thunderbolt, and
unfortunately it alighted full on the nose and eye of the great
Mr. Alibi, causing that gentleman to reel back into the arms of
the faithful thieves around.&nbsp; I cannot tell from what
quarter it proceeded, it was so sudden, but I saw that in the
neighbourhood whence it came stood five tall hussars, and I heard
a voice say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, look at that.&nbsp; Come on, Maister, don&rsquo;t
let us git into no row.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bumpkin, with the politeness of his nature, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good marnin&rsquo;, sir,&rdquo; and retired.</p>
<p>And thus thought the unfortunate prosecutor: &ldquo;This
&rsquo;ere country be all law, actions grows out o&rsquo;
actions, like that &rsquo;ere cooch that runs all over
everywhere&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then he saw the five
recruits strutting along with their caps at the side of their
heads, the straps across their chins, their riding-whips under
their arms, and walking with such a swagger that one would have
thought they had just put down a rebellion, or set up a
throne.</p>
<p>It was some time before, in the confusion of his mind, the
disappointed Bumpkin could realize the fact that there was any
connection between him and the military.&nbsp; But as he looked,
with half-closed eyes, suddenly the thought crossed his mind:
&ldquo;Why, that be like our Joe&mdash;that middle un.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so it was: they were walking at a fastish pace, and as
they strutted along Joe seemed to be marching <!-- page 287--><a
name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 287</span>away with
the whole farm and with all the pleasures of his past life.&nbsp;
Even Mrs. Bumpkin herself, in some extraordinary manner, seemed
to be eloping with him.&nbsp; Why was it?&nbsp; And now,
despondent, disappointed and humiliated, with his blood once more
up, poor old Bumpkin bethought himself seriously of his
position.&nbsp; For weeks he had been waiting for his case to
&ldquo;come on&rdquo;; weeks more might pass idly away unless he
made a stir.&nbsp; So he would call at the office of Mr.
Prigg.&nbsp; And being an artful man, he had a reason for calling
without further delay.&nbsp; It was this: his desire to see Prigg
before that gentleman should hear of his defeat.&nbsp; Prigg
would certainly blame him for not employing a solicitor, or going
to the Public Prosecutor.&nbsp; So to Prigg&rsquo;s he went about
three o&rsquo;clock on that Thursday afternoon.&nbsp; I do not
undertake to describe furniture, so I say nothing of
Prigg&rsquo;s dingy office, except this, that if Prigg had been a
spider, it was just the sort of corner in which I should have
expected him to spin his web.&nbsp; Being a man of enormous
practice, and in all probability having some fifty to sixty
representatives of county families to confer with, two hours
elapsed before Mr. Bumpkin could be introduced.&nbsp; The place,
small as it was, was filled with tin boxes bearing, no doubt,
eminent names.&nbsp; Horatio was busy copying drafts of marriage
settlements, conveyances, and other matters of great
importance.&nbsp; He had little time for gossip because his work
seemed urgent, and although he was particularly glad to see Mr.
Bumpkin, yet being a lad of strict adherence to duty, he always
replied courteously, but in the smallest number of words to that
gentleman&rsquo;s questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will ur be long?&rdquo; asked the client; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; said Horatio.</p>
<p><!-- page 288--><a name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
288</span>Then in a whisper, asked Mr. Bumpkin, &ldquo;How does
thee think, sir, we shall get on: win, shan&rsquo;t
us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Horatio just raised his face from the paper and winked, as
though he were conveying a valuable secret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have ur heard anythink, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another artful wink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thee know&rsquo;s zummat, I knows thee do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another artful wink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thee can tell I, surely?&nbsp; I wunt let un goo no
furder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Horatio winked once more, and made a face at the door where
the great Prigg was supposed to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t give in, ave ur?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Horatio put his finger in his mouth and made a popping noise
as he pulled it out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the devil does thee mean, lad? there be zummat up,
I&rsquo;ll swear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! hush!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, look here,&rdquo; said Bumpkin, taking out his
purse; &ldquo;thee beest a good chap, and writ out thic brief,
didn&rsquo;t thee?&nbsp; I got zummat for thee;&rdquo; and
hereupon he handed Horatio half-a-crown.</p>
<p>The youth took the money, spun it into the air, caught it in
the palm of his hand, spat on it for good luck, and put it in his
pocket</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have a spree with that,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;if I never do again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful, lad,&rdquo; said Bumpkin,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t fool un away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; said Horatio; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on for the
Argille tonight, please the pigs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be thic a place o&rsquo; wusship&rdquo; said Bumpkin,
laughing.</p>
<p><!-- page 289--><a name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
289</span>&ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; answered Horatio;
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s a place where you can just do the gentleman on
the cheap, shoulder it with noblemen&rsquo;s sons, and some of
the highest.&nbsp; Would you like to go now, just for a
lark?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;d like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; said the client; &ldquo;this &rsquo;ere
Lunnun life doan&rsquo;t do for I.&rsquo;.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; but this is a nice quiet sort of place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gals, I spoase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather; I believe you my boy; stunners too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thee be too young, it&rsquo;s my thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s what the Governor says; everybody
says I&rsquo;m too young; but I hope to mend that fault, Master
Bumpkin, if I don&rsquo;t get the better of any other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I wur as old in the &rsquo;ead; but tell I, lad,
hast thee &rsquo;eard anything?&nbsp; Thee might just as well
tell I; it wunt goo no furder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Horatio put his finger to his nose and made a number of dumb
signs, expressive of more than mere words could convey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Danged if I can mak&rsquo; thee out,&rdquo; said
Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You recollect that ride we had in the gig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, now it&rsquo;s coming,&rdquo; thought he; &ldquo;I
shall have un now,&rdquo; so he answered: &ldquo;Well, it wur
nice, wurn&rsquo;t ur?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never enjoyed myself more in my life,&rdquo; rejoined
Horatio; &ldquo;what a nice morning it was!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beautiful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you recollect the rum and milk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bumpkin remembered it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I believe that rum and milk was the luckiest
investment you ever made.&nbsp; Hallo! there&rsquo;s the
bell&mdash;hush, <i>mither woy</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 290--><a name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
290</span>&ldquo;Dang thee!&rdquo; said Bumpkin,
&ldquo;thee&rsquo;s got un;&rdquo; and he followed the youthful
clerk into Mr. Prigg&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>There sat that distinguished lawyer with his respectable head,
in his easy chair, much worn, both himself and the chair, by
constant use.&nbsp; There sat the good creature ready to offer
himself up on the altar of Benevolence for the good of the first
comer.&nbsp; His collar was still unruffled, so was his temper,
notwithstanding the severe strain of the county families.&nbsp;
There was his clear complexion indicating the continued health
resulting from a well-spent life.&nbsp; His almost angelic
features were beautiful rather in the amiability of their
expression than in their loveliness of form.&nbsp; Anyone looking
at him for the first time must exclaim, &ldquo;Dear me, what a
<i>nice</i> man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Bumpkin,&rdquo; said he, extending his left
hand lazily as though it were the last effort of exhausted
humanity, &ldquo;how are we now?&rdquo;&mdash;always identifying
himself with Bumpkin, as though he should say &ldquo;We are in
the same boat, brother; come what may, we sink or swim
together&mdash;how are we now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bean&rsquo;t wery well,&rdquo; answered Mr. Bumpkin,
&ldquo;I can tell &rsquo;ee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? dear me, why, what&rsquo;s the
matter?&nbsp; We must be cool, you know.&nbsp; Nothing like
coolness, if we are to win our battle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lookee &rsquo;ere,&rdquo; said Bumpkin; &ldquo;lookee
&rsquo;ere, sir; I bin here dordlin&rsquo; about off an&rsquo; on
six weeks, and this &rsquo;ere dam trial&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh&mdash;sh!&rdquo; remonstrated Mr. Prigg with the
softest voice, and just lifting his left hand on a level with his
forehead.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us learn resignation, good Mr.
Bumpkin.&nbsp; Let us learn it at the feet of disappointment and
losses and crosses.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 291--><a name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
291</span>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Bumpkin; &ldquo;but thic
larnin&rsquo; be spensive, I be payin&rsquo; for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Bumpkin,&rdquo; said the good man sternly,
&ldquo;the dispensations of Providence are not to be denounced in
this way.&nbsp; You are a man, Bumpkin; let us act, then, the
man&rsquo;s part.&nbsp; You see these boxes, these names: they
represent men who have gone through the furnace; let us be
patient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I be sick on it.&nbsp; I wish I&rsquo;d never
know&rsquo;d what law wur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, sir, most of us would like to exist in that state
of wild and uncultured freedom which only savages and beasts are
permitted to enjoy; but life has higher aims, Mr. Bumpkin;
grander pursuits; more sublime duties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, I bean&rsquo;t no schollard and so
can&rsquo;t argify; but if thee plase to tell I, sir, when this
case o&rsquo; mine be likely to come on&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just that minute going to write to you, Mr.
Bumpkin, as your name was announced, to say that it would not be
taken until next term.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bumpkin uttered an exclamation which is not for print, and
which caused the good Prigg to clap his hands to his ears and
press them tightly for five minutes.&nbsp; Then he took them away
and rubbed them together (I mean his hands), as though he were
washing them from the contaminating influence of Mr.
Bumpkin&rsquo;s language.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; he said, mechanically; &ldquo;dear
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What be quite so,&rdquo; asked Mr. Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;you see,&rdquo; said Prigg,
&ldquo;Her Majesty&rsquo;s Judges have to go circuit; or, as it
is technically called, jail delivery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They be allays gwine suckitt.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 292--><a name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
292</span>&ldquo;Quite so.&nbsp; That is precisely what the
profession is always observing.&nbsp; No sooner do they return
from one circuit than they start off on another.&nbsp; Are you
aware, Mr. Bumpkin, that we pay a judge five thousand a-year to
try a pickpocket?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hem!&rdquo; said Bumpkin, &ldquo;I bean&rsquo;t aware
on it.&nbsp; Never used t&rsquo; have so many o&rsquo; these
&rsquo;ere&mdash;what d&rsquo;ye call &rsquo;ems?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Circuits.&nbsp; No&mdash;but you see, here now is an
instance.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a prisoner away somewhere, I think
down at Bodmin, hundreds of miles off, and I believe he has sent
to say that they must come down and try him at once, for he
can&rsquo;t wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d mak&rsquo; un wait.&nbsp; Why should honest
men wait for sich as he?&nbsp; I bin waitin&rsquo; long
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so.&nbsp; And the consequence is that the Lord
Chief Justice of England is going down to try him, a common
pickpocket, I believe, and his Lordship is the very head of the
Judicial Body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hem!&rdquo; said Mr. Bumpkin; &ldquo;then I may as well
goo hoame?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; answered the amiable Prigg; &ldquo;in
fact, better&mdash;much better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; we shan&rsquo;t come on now, sir;
bean&rsquo;t there no chance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the least, my dear sir; but you see we have not
been idle; we have been advancing, in fact, during the whole time
that has seemed to you so long.&nbsp; Now, just look, my dear
sir; we have fought no less than ten appeals, right up, mind you,
to the Court of Appeal itself; we have fought two demurrers; we
have compelled them three times to give better answers to our
interrogatories, and we have had fourteen other <!-- page
293--><a name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
293</span>summonses at Chambers on which they have not thought
proper to appeal beyond the Judge.&nbsp; Now, Mr. Bumpkin, after
that, I <i>think</i> you ought to be satisfied; but really that
is one of the most disparaging things in the profession, the most
disparaging, I may say; we find it so difficult to show our
clients that we have done enough for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; thee think, sir, as we shall win un?&rdquo;
said Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Prigg, &ldquo;I never like to
prophesy; but if ever a case looked like winning it&rsquo;s
<i>Bumpkin</i> v. <i>Snooks</i>.&nbsp; And I may tell you this,
Mr. Bumpkin, only pray don&rsquo;t say that I told
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What be thic, sir?&rdquo; asked the eager client, with
his eyes open as widely as ever client&rsquo;s can be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, funkin&rsquo;, be um?&nbsp; I said so.&nbsp; That
there Snooks be a rank bad un&mdash;now, then, we&rsquo;ll at un
like steam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All in good time, Bumpkin,&rdquo; said the worthy
Prigg, affectionately taking his client&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp;
&ldquo;All in good time.&nbsp; My kind regards to Mrs.
Bumpkin.&nbsp; I suppose you return to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, sir, I be off by the fust train.&nbsp; Good day
t&rsquo; ye, sir; good day and thankee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus comforted and thus grateful did the confiding client take
leave of his legal adviser, who immediately took down his
costs-book and booked a long conference, including the two hours
that Mr. Bumpkin was kept in the &ldquo;outer
office.&rdquo;&nbsp; This followed immediately after another
&ldquo;long conference with you when you thought we should be in
the paper to-morrow from what a certain Mr. O&rsquo;Rapley had
told you, and I thought we should not.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 294--><a name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

shook.&nbsp; Horatio by the hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good-bye,
sir.&nbsp; I knows what it wur now&mdash;bean&rsquo;t
comin&rsquo; on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say I told you,&rdquo; said the pale boy,
as though he were afraid of communicating some tremendous
secret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noa, thee bean&rsquo;t told I.&nbsp; Now, lookee

<p class="gutsumm">Mr. Bumpkin at home again.</p>
<p>How peaceful the farm seemed after all the turmoil and worry
that Farmer Bumpkin had been subjected to in London!&nbsp; What a
haven of rest is a peaceful Home!&nbsp; How the ducks seemed to
quack!&mdash;louder, as Mr. Bumpkin thought, than they ever did
before.&nbsp; The little flock of sheep looked up as he went,
with his old ash stick under his arm, to look round the
farm.&nbsp; They seemed to say to one another, &ldquo;Why,
here&rsquo;s Master; I told you he&rsquo;d come
back.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the cows turned their heads and bellowed a
loud welcome.&nbsp; They knew nothing of his troubles, and only
expressed their extreme pleasure at seeing him again.&nbsp; They
left off eating the whole time he was with them; for they were
very well bred Shorthorns and Alderneys.&nbsp; It was quite
pleasant to see how well behaved they all were.&nbsp; And Mrs.
Bumpkin pointed out which ones had calved and which were expected
to calve in the course of a few months.&nbsp; And then the
majestic bull looked up with an expression of immense delight;
came up to Mr. Bumpkin and put his nose in his master&rsquo;s
hand, and gazed as only a bull would gaze on a farmer who had
spent several weeks in London.&nbsp; It was astonishing with what
admiration the bull regarded him; and he seemed quite delighted
as Mrs. Bumpkin told her husband of the bull&rsquo;s good conduct
in his absence; how he had never broken bounds once, <!-- page
296--><a name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
296</span>and had behaved himself as an exemplary bull on all
occasions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bumpkin, &ldquo;I be
&rsquo;bliged to say, Tom, that there Mrs. Snooks have belied him
shamefully.&nbsp; She haven&rsquo;t got a good word to say for
un; nor, for the matter o&rsquo; that, for anything on the
farm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumpkin; &ldquo;he
bean&rsquo;t the only one as &rsquo;ave been slandered
hereabouts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Tom, sure enough; but we bean&rsquo;t &rsquo;bliged
to heed un.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, nor wun&rsquo;t.&nbsp; And now here come
Tim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To see Tim run and bound and leap and put his paws round Mr.
Bumpkin&rsquo;s neck and lick him, was a sight which must have
made up for a great deal of the unkindness which he had
experienced of late.&nbsp; Nor could any dog say more plainly
than Tim did, how he had had a row with that ill-natured cur of
Snooks&rsquo;, called Towser, and how he had driven him off the
farm and forbade him ever setting foot on it again.&nbsp; Tim
told all about the snarling of Towser, and said he would not have
minded his taking Snooks&rsquo; part in the action, if he had
confined himself to that; but when he went on and barked at Mr.
Bumpkin&rsquo;s sheep and pigs, against whom he ought to have
shown no ill-feeling, it was more than Tim could stand; so he
flew at him and thoroughly well punished him for his malignant
disposition.</p>
<p>But in the midst of all this welcoming, there was an
unpleasant experience, and that was, that all the pigs were gone
but two.&nbsp; The rare old Chichester sow was no more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There be only two affidavys left, Nancy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Tom&mdash;only two; the man fetched two
yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 297--><a name="page297"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
297</span>&ldquo;I hope they sold well.&nbsp; Have he sent any
money yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a farthing,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bumpkin; &ldquo;nor
yet for the sheep.&nbsp; He have had six sheep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zo I zee; and where be th&rsquo; heifers? we had
six.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They be all sold, Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how much did &rsquo;em fetch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man ain&rsquo;t brought in the account yet, Tom;
but I spect we shall have un soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumpkin, looking at the stackyard,
&ldquo;another rick be gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Tom, it be gone, and fine good hay it wur; it cut
out as well as any hay I ever zeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure did ur!&rdquo; answered Tom; &ldquo;it were the
six ak&rsquo;r o&rsquo; clover, and were got up wirout a drop
o&rsquo; rain on un; it wur prime hay, thic.&nbsp; Why, I wur
offered six pun&rsquo; a looad for un.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;ow what ur fetched, Tom; but I be mighty
troubled about this &rsquo;ere lawsuit.&nbsp; I wish we&rsquo;d
never &rsquo;a had un.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doan&rsquo;t say thic, Nancy; we be bound to bring
un.&nbsp; As Laryer Prigg say, it bean&rsquo;t so much t&rsquo;
pig&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Tom, thee said un fust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, s&rsquo;poase I did&mdash;so ur did, and it
worn&rsquo;t so much t&rsquo; pig, it wur thic feller&rsquo;s
cheek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know nothing about un; I dissay you
be right, because you&rsquo;ve allays been right, Tom; and
we&rsquo;ve allays got on well togither these five and thirty
year: but, some&rsquo;ow, Tom&mdash;down, Tim!&mdash;down,
Tim!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor old Tim!&rdquo; said Tom.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good
boy!&nbsp; I wish men wur as good as dogs be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some&rsquo;ow,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Bumpkin, &ldquo;I
doan&rsquo;t <!-- page 298--><a name="page298"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 298</span>like that &rsquo;aire Prigg; he seem
to shake his head too much for I; and &rsquo;olds his &rsquo;at
up to his face too long in church when ur goes in; and then ur
shakes his head so much when ur prays.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t like
un, Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Nancy, thee knows nothing about un.&nbsp; I can
tell &rsquo;ee he be a rare good man, and sich a clever lawyer,
he&rsquo;ll knock that &rsquo;aire Snooks out o&rsquo;
time.&nbsp; But, come on, let&rsquo;s goo in and &rsquo;ave some
ta.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they went in.&nbsp; And a very comfortable tea there was
set out on the old oak table in front of the large fireplace
where the dog-irons were.&nbsp; And a bright, blazing log there
was on the hearth; for a cold east wind was blowing,
notwithstanding that the sun had shone out bravely in the
day.&nbsp; Ah! how glad Tom was to see the bright pewter plates
and dishes ranged in rows all round the homely kitchen!&nbsp;
They seemed to smile a welcome on the master; and one very large
family sort of dish seemed to go out of his way to give him
welcome.&nbsp; I believe he tumbled down in his enthusiasm at
Tom&rsquo;s return, although it was accounted for by saying that
Tim had done it by the excessive &ldquo;waggling&rdquo; of his
tail.&nbsp; I believe that dish fell down in the name of all the
plates and dishes on the shelves, for the purpose of
congratulating the master; else why should all their faces
brighten up so suddenly with smiles as he did so?&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s ridiculous to suppose plates and dishes have no
feelings; they&rsquo;ve a great deal more than some people.&nbsp;
And then, how the great, big, bright copper kettle, suspended on
his hook, which was in the centre of the huge fireplace, how he
did sing!&nbsp; Why the nightingale couldn&rsquo;t throw more
feeling into a song than did that old kettle!&nbsp; And then the
home-made bread and rashers of bacon, such as you never see out
of a farmhouse; and tea, such as can&rsquo;t <!-- page 299--><a
name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 299</span>be made
anywhere else!&nbsp; And then the long pipe was brought out of
his corner, where he had been just as Tom had left it before
going to town.&nbsp; And the bowl of that pipe gave off circular
clouds of the bluest smoke, expressive of its joy at the
master&rsquo;s return: it wasn&rsquo;t very expressive, perhaps,
but it was all that a pipe could do; and when one does his best
in this world, it is all that mortal man can expect of him.</p>
<p>And then said Mrs. Bumpkin,&mdash;still dubious as to the
policy of the proceedings, but too loving to combat her husband
upon them,&mdash;&ldquo;When be thee gwine agin, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doan&rsquo;t rightly know,&rdquo; said Bumpkin.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mr. Prigg will let I know; sometime in May, I
reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, dear!&rdquo; said Mrs. Bumpkin; &ldquo;it may be
on, then, just as th&rsquo; haymakin&rsquo;s about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lor, lor! no, dearie; it&rsquo;ll be over long enough
afore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doan&rsquo;t be too sure, Tom; it be a long time now
since it begun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;a long time enough; but
it&rsquo;ll be in th&rsquo; paper afore long now; an&rsquo; we
got one o&rsquo; the cleverest counsel in Lunnun?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What be his name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Danged if I know, but it be one o&rsquo; the stunninest
men o&rsquo; the day; two on &rsquo;em, by Golly; we got two,
Nancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who be th&rsquo; tother? p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps thee med
mind his name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noa, I doan&rsquo;t mind his name nuther.&nbsp; Now,
what d&rsquo;ye think o&rsquo; thic?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Bumpkin laughed, and said, &ldquo;I think it be a rum
thing that thee &rsquo;as counsellors and doan&rsquo;t mind their
names.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 300--><a name="page300"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
300</span>And then the conversation turned upon Joe, whose place
was vacant in the old chimney corner.</p>
<p>The tears ran down Mrs. Bumpkin&rsquo;s rosy cheeks as she
said for the twentieth time since Mr. Bumpkin&rsquo;s
return,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Joe! why did ur goo for a soger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wur a fool!&rdquo; said Bumpkin, &ldquo;and I told
un so.&nbsp; So as I warned un about thic Sergeant; the
artfullest man as ever lived, Nancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Bumpkin wiped her eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;He wur a good boy,
wur Joe, goo where ur wool; but, Tom, couldn&rsquo;t thee
&rsquo;a&rsquo; kept thine eye on un when thee see thic Sergeant
hoverin&rsquo; roun&rsquo; like a &rsquo;awk arter a
sparrer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did keep eye on un, I tell &rsquo;ee; but what be the
good o&rsquo; thic; as well keep thee eye on th&rsquo; sparrer
when th&rsquo; hawk be at un.&nbsp; I tell &rsquo;ee I
&rsquo;suaded un and warned un, and begged on un to look
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; what did ur say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, why said ur wur up to un.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up to un,&rdquo; repeated Mrs. Bumpkin.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t think &rsquo;ow ur got &rsquo;old on
un.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, and thee mark I, no more can nobody else&mdash;in
Lunnon thee&rsquo;re &rsquo;ad afore thee knows where thee
be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now Mr. Bumpkin had his &ldquo;little drop of warm gin and
water before going to bed&rdquo;: and Mrs. Bumpkin had a mug of
elder wine, for the Christmas elder wine was not quite gone: and
after that Mrs. Bumpkin, who as the reader knows, was the better
scholar of the two, took down from a shelf on which the family
documents and books were kept, a large old bible covered with
green baize.&nbsp; Then she wiped her glasses, and after turning
over the old brown leaves until she came to the place where she
had read last before Tom went away, commenced <!-- page 301--><a
name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 301</span>her evening
task, while her husband smoked on and listened.</p>
<p>Was it the old tone with which she spelt her way through the
sacred words?&nbsp; Hardly: here it could be perceived that in
her secret heart there was doubt and mistrust.&nbsp; Do what she
would her eyes frequently became so dim that it was necessary to
pause and wipe her glasses; and when she had finished and closed
the book, she took Tom&rsquo;s hand and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, Tom, I hope all &rsquo;ll turn out well, but sure
enough I ha&rsquo; misgivings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What be it, my dear?&nbsp; Mr. Prigg say we shall
win&mdash;how can ur do better &rsquo;an thic?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we get back the pigs and sheep, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Bumpkin looked into her lap, and folding her apron very
smooth with both hands, answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doan&rsquo;t think, Tom, that man looks like bringing
anything back.&nbsp; He be very chuffy and masterful, and looks
all round as he goo away, as though he wur lookin&rsquo; to see
what ur would take next.&nbsp; I think he&rsquo;ll have un all,
Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stuff!&rdquo; said Mr. Bumpkin, &ldquo;he be
sellin&rsquo; for I, take what ur may.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He be sellin&rsquo; <span class="smcap">thee</span>,
Tom, I think, and I&rsquo;d stop un from takin&rsquo;
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They rose to go to bed, and as Mrs. Bumpkin looked at the cosy
old hearth, and put up the embers of the log to make it safe for
the night, it seemed as if the prosperity of their old home had
burnt down at last to dull ashes, and she looked sadly at the
vacant place where Joe had used to sit.</p>
<h2><!-- page 303--><a name="page303"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 303</span>CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Joe&rsquo;s return to Southwood&mdash;an
invitation from the Vicar&mdash;what the old oak saw.</p>
<p>It was a long time after the circumstances mentioned in the
last chapter.&nbsp; The jails had been &ldquo;delivered&rdquo; of
their prisoners, and prodigious events had taken place in the
world; great battles had been fought and won, great laws made for
the future interpretation of judges, and for the vexation of
unfortunate suitors.&nbsp; It seemed an age to Mr. Bumpkin since
his case commenced; and Joe had been in foreign parts and won his
share of the glory and renown that falls to the lot of privates
who have helped to achieve victory for the honour and glory of
their General and the happiness of their country.&nbsp; It was a
very long time, measured by events, since Mr. Bumpkin&rsquo;s
return from town, when on a bright morning towards the end of
June, a fine sunburnt soldier of Her Majesty&rsquo;s regiment of
the --- Hussars knocked with the butt-end of his riding whip at
the old oak door in the old porch of Southwood farm-house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I never! if that there bean&rsquo;t our
Joe!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Bumpkin, looking out of the window;
and throwing down the rolling-pin which she had just been using
in rolling-out the dough for a dumpling&mdash;(Mr. Bumpkin was
&ldquo;uncommon fond o&rsquo; dumplins&rdquo;)&mdash;&ldquo;well,
I never!&rdquo; repeated Mrs. Bumpkin, as she opened <!-- page
304--><a name="page304"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
304</span>the door; &ldquo;who ever would ha&rsquo; thought
it?&nbsp; Why, how be&rsquo;est thee, Joe?&nbsp; And bless the
lad, &rsquo;ow thee&rsquo;ve growed!&nbsp; My &rsquo;art alive,
come along!&nbsp; The master&rsquo;ll be mighty glad to see thee,
and so be I, sure a ly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And here Mrs. Bumpkin paused to look round him, sticking her
knuckles in her sides and her elbows in the air as though Joe
were a piece of handiwork&mdash;a dumpling, say&mdash;which she
herself had turned out, clothes and all.&nbsp; And then she put
the corner of her apron to her eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Joe, I thought,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I should
never see thee agin!&nbsp; Dear, dear, this &rsquo;ere lawsuit be
the ruin on us, mark my words!&nbsp; But lor, don&rsquo;t say as
I said so to the master for the world, for he be that wropped up
in un that nothing goes down night and morning, morning and
night, but affidavys, and summonses, and counsellors, and
jussices, and what not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the soldier, slapping his whip on his
leg as was his custom, &ldquo;you might be sure I should come and
see yer if they left me a leg to hop with, and I should &rsquo;a
wrote, but what wi&rsquo; the smoke and what with the cannon
balls flying about, you haven&rsquo;t got much time to think
about anything; but I did think this, that if ever I got back to
Old England, if it was twenty year to come, I&rsquo;d go and see
the old master and missus and &rsquo;ear &rsquo;ow that lawsuit
wur going on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that be right, Joe&mdash;I knowed &rsquo;ee would;
I said as much to master.&nbsp; But &rsquo;ow do thee think
it&rsquo;ll end? shall us win or lose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now this was the first time he had ever been called upon to
give a legal opinion, or rather, an opinion upon a legal matter,
so he was naturally somewhat put about; <!-- page 305--><a
name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 305</span>and looking
at the rolling-pin and the dough and then at Mrs. Bumpkin,
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s like this: a man med win or a man med
lose, there&rsquo;s no telling about the case; but I be
dang&rsquo;d well sure o&rsquo; this, missus, he&rsquo;ll lose
his money: I wish master had chucked her up long agoo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This opinion was not encouraging; and perceiving that the
subject troubled Mrs. Bumpkin more than she liked to confess, he
asked a question which was of more immediate importance to
himself, and that was in reference to Polly Sweetlove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, thee&rsquo;ll make her look at thee now,
I&rsquo;ll warrant; thy clothes fit thee as though they growed on
thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do she walk with the baker?&rdquo; inquired Joe, with
trembling accents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never heeard so, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s my belief she
never looked at un wi&rsquo; any meaning.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seen
her many a time comin&rsquo; down the Green Lane by herself and
peepin&rsquo; over th&rsquo; gate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now look at that!&rdquo; said Joe; &ldquo;and when I
was here I couldn&rsquo;t get Polly to come near the
farm&mdash;allays some excuse&mdash;did you ever speak to her
about me, missus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t going to tell tales out of school, Joe,
so there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now look at that,&rdquo; said Joe; &ldquo;here&rsquo;s
a chap comes all this way and you won&rsquo;t tell him
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Bumpkin laughed, and went on rolling the dough, and told
him what a nice dumpling she was making, and how he would like
it, and asked how long he was going to stop, and hoped it would
be a month, and was telling him all about the sheep and the cows
<!-- page 306--><a name="page306"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
306</span>and the good behaviour of the bull, when suddenly she
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here he be, Joe! lor, lor, how glad he&rsquo;ll be to
see thee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t the Bull that stepped into the room; it
was Mr. Bumpkin, rosy, stalwart, jolly, and artful as ever.&nbsp;
Now Mrs. Bumpkin was very anxious to be the bearer of such good
intelligence as Joe&rsquo;s arrival, so, notwithstanding the fact
that Mr. Bumpkin and he were face to face, the eager woman
exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here be our Joe, Tom, hearty and well.&nbsp; And
bean&rsquo;t he a smart fine feller?&nbsp; What&rsquo;ll Polly
think of un now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up thic chatter,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumpkin,
laughing.&nbsp; &ldquo;Halloa! why, Joe, egad thee looks like a
gineral.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d take thee for a kernel at the wery
least.&nbsp; Why, when did thee come, lad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just now, master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That be right, an&rsquo; I be glad to see thee.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll warrant Nancy ain&rsquo;t axed thee t&rsquo; have
nothun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, thee be welcome to the &rsquo;ouse if thee can eat
un, thee knows thic,&rdquo; answered Nancy; &ldquo;but
dinner&rsquo;ll be ready at twelve, and thee best not spoil
un.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A quart o&rsquo; ale wun&rsquo;t spile un, will un,
Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now look at that,&rdquo; said the soldier.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thankee, master, but not a quart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, thee hasn&rsquo;t got thee head snicked off yet,
Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, master, if my head had been snicked off I
couldn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; bin here.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he laughed a
loud ha! ha! ha!</p>
<p>And Mr. Bumpkin laughed a loud haw! haw! haw! at this
tremendous witticism.&nbsp; It was not much of a <!-- page
307--><a name="page307"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
307</span>witticism, perhaps, after all, when duly considered,
but it answered the purpose as well as the very best, and
produced as much pleasure as the most brilliant <i>repartee</i>,
in the most fashionable circles.&nbsp; We must take people as
they are.</p>
<p>So Joe stayed chattering away till dinner-time, and then,
referring to the pudding, said he had never tasted anything like
it in his life; and went on telling the old people all the
wonders of the campaign: how their regiment just mowed down the
enemy as he used to cut corn in the harvest-field, and how
nothing could stand aginst a charge of cavalry; and how they
liked their officers; and how their General, who warn&rsquo;t
above up to Joe&rsquo;s shoulder, were a genleman, every inch on
him, an&rsquo; as brave as any lion you could pick out.&nbsp; And
so he went on, until Mr. Bumpkin said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; if I had my time over agin I&rsquo;d goo for
a soger too, Joe,&rdquo; which made Mrs. Bumpkin laugh and ask
what would become of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! ha! ha! look at that!&rdquo; said Joe;
&ldquo;she&rsquo;s got you there, master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No she bean&rsquo;t, she&rsquo;d a married thic feller
that wur so sweet on her afore I had ur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, Jem?&rdquo; said Mrs. Bumpkin, &ldquo;why I
wouldn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; had un, Tom, if every &rsquo;air had
been hung wi&rsquo; dimonds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now look at that,&rdquo; laughed Joe.</p>
<p>And so they went on until it was time to take a turn round the
farm.&nbsp; Everything seemed startled at Joe&rsquo;s fine
clothes, especially the bull, who snorted and pawed the earth and
put out his tail, and placed his head to the ground, until Joe
called him by name, and then, as he told his comrades afterwards
in barracks, the bull said:</p>
<p><!-- page 308--><a name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
308</span>&ldquo;Why danged if it bean&rsquo;t our
Joe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I must confess I did not hear this observation in my dream,
but I was some distance off, and if Mr. Ricochet, Q.C., in
cross-examination had said, &ldquo;Will you swear, sir, upon your
oath that the bull did not use those words?&rdquo; I must have
been bound to answer, &ldquo;I will not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But presently they met old Tim, the Collie, and there was no
need for Joe to speak to him.&nbsp; Up he came with a bound and
caressed his old mate in the most loving manner.</p>
<p>The Queen&rsquo;s uniform was no disguise to him.</p>
<p>The next day it was quite a treat to see Joe go through the
village.&nbsp; Such a swagger he put on that you would have
thought he was the whole regiment.&nbsp; And when he went by the
Vicarage, where Polly was housemaid, it was remarkable to see the
air of indifference which he assumed.&nbsp; Whack went his
riding-whip on his leg: you could hear it a hundred yards
off.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t seem to care a bit whether she was
staring at him out of the study window as hard as she could stare
or not.&nbsp; Two or three times he struck the same leg, and
marched on perfectly indifferent to all around.</p>
<p>At length came Sunday, as Sunday only comes in a country
village.&nbsp; No such peace, no such Sabbath anywhere.&nbsp; You
have only got to look at anything you like to know that it is
Sunday.&nbsp; Bill&rsquo;s shirt collar; the milkman; even his
bright milk-can has a Sunday shine about it.&nbsp; The cows
standing in the shallow brook have a reverent air about
them.&nbsp; They never look like that on any other day.&nbsp; Why
the very sunshine is Sabbath sunshine, and seems to bring more
peace and more pleasantness than on any other day of the
week.&nbsp; And <!-- page 309--><a name="page309"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 309</span>all the trees seem to whisper
together, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Sunday morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently you see the people straggling up to the little
church, whose donging bell keeps on as much as to say, &ldquo;I
know I&rsquo;m not much of a peal, but in my humble way I do my
duty to the best of my ability; it&rsquo;s not the sound but the
spirit of the thing that is required; and if I&rsquo;m not very
musical, and can&rsquo;t give you many changes, I&rsquo;m sincere
in what I say.&rdquo;&nbsp; And this was an emblem of the
sincerity and the simplicity of the clergyman inside.&nbsp; He
kept on hammering away at the old truths and performing his part
in God&rsquo;s great work to the best of his ability; and I know
with very great success.&nbsp; So in they all came to church; and
Joe, who had been a very good Sunday-school pupil
(notwithstanding his love of poaching) and was a favourite with
the vicar, as the reader knows, took his old place in the free
seats, not very far from the pew where the vicar&rsquo;s servants
sat.&nbsp; Who can tell what his feelings were as he wondered
whether Polly would be there that morning?</p>
<p>The other servants came in.&nbsp; Ah, dear!&nbsp; Polly
can&rsquo;t come, now look at that!&nbsp; Just as he was thinking
this in she came.&nbsp; Such a flutter in her heart as she saw
the bright uniform and the brighter face, bronzed with a foreign
clime and looking as handsome as ever a face could look.&nbsp; O
what a flutter too in Joe&rsquo;s heart!&nbsp; But he was
determined not to care for her.&nbsp; So he wouldn&rsquo;t look,
and that was a very good way; and he certainly would have kept
his word if he could.</p>
<p>I think if I had to choose where and how I would be admired,
if ever such a luxury could come to me, I would be Joe Wurzel
under present circumstances.&nbsp; A young hero, handsome, tall,
in the uniform of the <!-- page 310--><a name="page310"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 310</span>Hussars, with a loved one near and
all the village girls fixing their eyes on me!&nbsp; That for
once only, and my utmost ambition would be gratified.&nbsp; Life
could have no greater pride for me.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know
whether the sermon made much impression that day, but of the two,
I verily believe Joe made the most; and as they streamed out of
the little church all the young faces of the congregation were
turned to him: and everywhere when they got outside it was,
&ldquo;Halloa, Joe!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, Joe, my lad, what
cheer?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Dang&rsquo;d if here bean&rsquo;t
Joe!&rdquo; and other exclamations of welcome and surprise.&nbsp;
And then, how all the pinafored boys flocked round and gazed with
wondering eyes at this conquering hero; chattering to one another
and contradicting one another about what this part of his uniform
was and what that part was, and so on; but all agreeing that Joe
was about the finest sight that had come into Yokelton since ever
it was a place.</p>
<p>And then the old clergyman sent for him and was as kind as
ever he could be; and Joe was on the enchanted ground where the
fairy Polly flitted about as noiselessly as a butterfly.&nbsp;
Ah, and what&rsquo;s this?&nbsp; Now let not the reader be
over-anxious; for a few lines I must keep you, gentle one, in
suspense; a great surprise must be duly prepared.&nbsp; If I told
you at once what I saw, you would not think so much of it as if I
kept you a little while in a state of wondering curiosity.&nbsp;
What do you think happened in the Vicarage?</p>
<p>Now&rsquo;s the moment to tell it in a fresh paragraph.&nbsp;
Why in came the fairy with a little tray of cake and wine!&nbsp;
Now pause on that before I say any more.&nbsp; What about their
eyes?&nbsp; Did they swim?&nbsp; What about their hearts; did
they flutter?&nbsp; Did Polly blush?&nbsp; Did Joe&rsquo;s
bronzed face shine?&nbsp; Ah, it all took place, and <!-- page
311--><a name="page311"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
311</span>much more than I could tell in a whole volume.&nbsp;
The vicar did not perceive it, for luckily he was looking out of
the window.&nbsp; It only took a moment to place the tray on the
table, and the fairy disappeared.&nbsp; But that moment, not then
considered as of so much importance, exciting as it was, stamped
the whole lives of two beings, and who can tell whether or no
such a moment leaves its impress on Eternity?</p>
<p>All good and all kind was the old vicar; and how attentively
he listened with Mrs. Goodheart to the eye-witness of
England&rsquo;s great deeds!&nbsp; And then&mdash;no, he did not
give Joe a claptrap maudlin sermon, but treated him as a man
subject to human frailties, and, only hoped in all his career he
would remember some of the things he had been taught at the
Sunday School.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Joe, &ldquo;ay, sir, and the best
lesson I ever larned, and what have done me most good, be the
kindness I always had from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they parted, and a day or two after, strangely enough, just
as Joe was walking along by the old Oak that is haunted, and
which the owls and the ghosts occupy between them, who should
come down the lane in the opposite direction but Polly
Sweetlove!&nbsp; Where she came from was the greatest mystery in
the world!&nbsp; And it was so extraordinary that Joe should meet
her: and he said so, as soon as he could speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now look at that!&nbsp; Whoever would have thought of
meeting anybody here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Polly hung down her head and blushed.&nbsp; Neither of them
knew what to say for a long time; for Joe was not a spokesman to
any extent.&nbsp; At last Polly Sweetlove broke silence and
murmured in the softest voice, and I should think the very
sweetest ever heard in this world:</p>
<p><!-- page 312--><a name="page312"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
312</span>&ldquo;Are you going away soon, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friday,&rdquo; answered the young Hussar.</p>
<p>Ah me!&nbsp; This was Wednesday already; to-morrow would be
Thursday, and the next day Friday!&nbsp; I did not hear this, but
I give you my word it took place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you coming to see the Vicar again?&rdquo; asked the
sweet voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Joe.</p>
<p>They both looked down at the gnarled roots of the old
tree&mdash;the roots did stick out a long way, and I suppose
attracted their attention&mdash;and then Polly just touched the
big root with her tiny toe.&nbsp; And the point of that tiny toe
touched Joe&rsquo;s heart too, which seemed to have got into that
root somehow, and sent a thrill as of an electric shock, only
much pleasanter, right through his whole body, and even into the
roots of his hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When are you coming again?&rdquo; whispered the sweet
lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said the young soldier;
&ldquo;perhaps never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll come and see&mdash;your
mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O yes,&rdquo; answered Joe, &ldquo;I shall come and see
mother; but what&rsquo;s it matter to thee, lassie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lassie blushed, and Joe thought it a good opportunity to
take hold of her hand.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know why, but he did;
and he was greatly surprised that the hand did not run away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the Vicar likes you, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do he?&rdquo; and he kept drawing nearer and nearer,
little by little, until his other hand went clean round Polly
Sweetlove&rsquo;s waist, and&mdash;well an owl flew out of the
tree at that moment, and drew off my attention; but afterwards
<!-- page 313--><a name="page313"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
313</span>I saw that they both kept looking at the root of the
tree, and then Joe said;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you love th&rsquo; baker, Polly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; whispered Polly; &ldquo;no, no,
never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, look at that!&rdquo; said Joe, recovering himself
a little; &ldquo;I always thought you liked the baker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never, Joe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, why didn&rsquo;t you look at me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Polly blushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe, they said you was so wild.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, look at that,&rdquo; said Joe; &ldquo;did you ever
see me wild, Polly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never, Joe&mdash;I will say that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, and you can ask my mother or Mrs. Bumpkin, or the
Vicar, or anybody else you like, Polly&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall go and see your mother,&rdquo; said Polly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you come to-morrow night?&rdquo; asked Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I can get away I will; but I must go
now&mdash;good-bye&mdash;good-bye&mdash;good&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you in a hurry, Polly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must go, Joe&mdash;good&mdash;; but I will come
to-morrow, as soon as dinner is
over&mdash;good&mdash;good&mdash;good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; but the Old Oak kept his
counsel.&nbsp; Here I awoke.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; cried my wife, &ldquo;you have broken off
abruptly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; quoth I, rubbing my
eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;I cannot help waking any more than I can help
going to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 314--><a name="page314"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
314</span>&ldquo;Well, this would be a very pretty little
courtship if true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;if I have described all that
I saw in my dream, you may depend upon it it is true.&nbsp; But
when I go to Southwood I will ask the Old Oak, for we are the
greatest friends imaginable, and he tells me everything.&nbsp; He
has known me ever since I was a child, and never sees me but he
enters into conversation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The past, present, and future&mdash;a very fruitful
subject of conversation, I assure you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wide enough, certainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None too wide for a tree of his standing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask him, dear, if Joe will marry this Polly
Sweetlove.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will not tell me that; he makes a special
reservation in favour of lovers&rsquo; secrets.&nbsp; They would
not confide their loves to his keeping so often as they do if he
betrayed them.&nbsp; No, he&rsquo;s a staunch old fellow in that
respect, and the consequence is, that for centuries lovers have
breathed their vows under his protecting branches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for that&mdash;I mean I am sorry he
will not tell you about this young couple, for I should like to
know if they will marry.&nbsp; Indeed, you must find out somehow,
for everyone who reads your book will be curious on this
subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, as to whether ploughman Joe will marry Polly the
housemaid.&nbsp; Had he been the eldest son of the Squire now,
and she the Vicar&rsquo;s daughter, instead of the
maid&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would not have been a whit more interesting, for
love is love, and human nature the same in high and <!-- page
315--><a name="page315"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
315</span>low degree.&nbsp; But, perhaps, this old tree
doesn&rsquo;t know anything about future events?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He knows from his long experience of the past what will
happen if certain conditions are given; he knows, for instance,
the secret whispers, and the silent tokens exchanged beneath his
boughs, and from them he knows what will assuredly result if
things take their ordinary course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So does anyone, prophet or no prophet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But his process of reasoning, based upon the experience
of a thousand years, is unerring; he saw William the Conqueror,
and listened to a council of war held under his branches; he knew
what would happen if William&rsquo;s projects were successful:
whether they would be successful was not within his
knowledge.&nbsp; He was intimately acquainted with Herne&rsquo;s
Oak at Windsor, and they frequently visited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Visited! how was that possible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite possible; trees visit one another just the same
as human beings&mdash;they hold intercourse by means of the
wind.&nbsp; For instance, when the wind blows from the
north-east, Southwood Oak visits at Windsor Park, and when the
wind is in the opposite direction a return visit is paid.&nbsp;
There isn&rsquo;t a tree of any position in England but the Old
Oak of Southwood knows.&nbsp; He is in himself the History of
England, only he is unlike all other histories, for he speaks the
truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have witnessed many love scenes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thousands!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me some?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not now&mdash;besides, I must ask leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he ever tell you anything about
yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A great deal&mdash;it is our principal topic of
conversation; <!-- page 316--><a name="page316"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 316</span>but he always begins it, lest my
modesty should prevent any intercourse on the subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has he said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A great deal: he has inspired me with hope, even
instilled into me some ambition: he has tried to impart to me an
admiration of all that is true, and to awaken a detestation of
all that is mean and pettifogging.&nbsp; I never look at him but
I see the symbol of all that is noble, grand and brave: he is the
emblem of stability, friendship and affection; a monument of
courage, honesty, and fidelity; he is the type of manly
independence and self-reliance.&nbsp; I am glad, therefore, that
under his beautiful branches, and within his protecting presence,
two young hearts have again met and pledged, as I believe they
have, their troth, honestly resolving to battle together against
the storms of life, rooted in stedfast love, and rejoicing in the
sunshine of the Creator&rsquo;s smiles!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After these observations, which were received with marked
approval, I again gave myself up to the soft influence of a
dreamy repose.</p>
<h2><!-- page 317--><a name="page317"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 317</span>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">A consultation as to new lodgings.&mdash;Also
a consultation with counsel.</p>
<p>It was a subject of grave discussion between the Bumpkins and
Joe, as to where would be the best place for the plaintiff to
lodge on his next visit to London.&nbsp; If he had moved in the
upper ranks of life, in all probability he would have taken Mrs.
Bumpkin to his town house: but being only a plain man and a
farmer, it was necessary to decide upon the most convenient, and
at the same time, inexpensive locality.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bumpkin, who, of course, knew all about her
husband&rsquo;s adventures, was strongly opposed to his returning
to the Goose.&nbsp; Never had created thing lost so much in her
estimation by mere association as this domestic bird.&nbsp; Joe
was a fine soldier, no doubt, but it was the Goose that had taken
him in.</p>
<p>Curiously enough, as they were discussing this important
question, who should come in but honest Lawyer Prigg himself.</p>
<p>What a blessing that man seemed to be, go where he
would!&nbsp; Why, he spread an air of hope and cheerfulness over
this simple household the moment he entered it!&nbsp; But the
greatest virtue he dispensed was resignation; he had a large
stock of this on hand.&nbsp; He always preached <!-- page
318--><a name="page318"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
318</span>it: &ldquo;resignation to the will of
Providence;&rdquo; resignation to him, Prigg!</p>
<p>So when he came in with his respectable head, professional
collar, and virtuous necktie, Mr. and Mrs. Bumpkin could not
choose but rise.&nbsp; Mr. Bumpkin meekly pulled his hair, and
humbly bowed obeisance as to his benefactor.&nbsp; Mrs. Bumpkin
curtseyed as to a superior power, whom she could not recognize as
a benefactor.&nbsp; Joe stood up, and looked as if he
couldn&rsquo;t quite make out what Mr. Prigg was.&nbsp; He knew
he worked the Law somehow, and &ldquo;summut like as a man works
a steam-threshing machine, but how or by what means, was a
mystery unrevealed to the mind of the simple soldier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning! good morning!&rdquo; said Mr. Prigg,
after the manner of a patriarch conferring a blessing.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, Joe, so you are returned, are you?&nbsp; Come, now,
let me shake hands with one of our brave heroes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>What condescension! and his tone was the tone of a man
reaching down from a giddy height to the world beneath him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you were in the thick of the fight, were
you&mdash;dear me! what a charge that was!&rdquo;&nbsp; Ah, but,
dear reader, you should see Prigg&rsquo;s charges!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wur someur about, sir,&rdquo; said Joe.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I dunnow where now though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; said Mr. Prigg, &ldquo;it was a great
victory; I&rsquo;m told the enemy ran away directly they heard
our troops were coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now look at that,&rdquo; said Joe; &ldquo;what a lot of
lies do get about sure-ly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; said Mr. Prigg; &ldquo;but you beat
them, did you not? we won the battle?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 319--><a name="page319"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
319</span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right enough,&rdquo; said Joe;
&ldquo;but if they&rsquo;d run away we couldn&rsquo;t a beat
un&mdash;&rsquo;tain&rsquo;t much of a fight when there&rsquo;s
no enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haw, haw, haw!&rdquo; laughed Bumpkin.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That be good, Mr. Prigg, that be good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, very good, indeed,&rdquo; said Mr. Prigg;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder at your winning if you could make
such sallies as that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that was good for Mr. Prigg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to
business&mdash;business, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We be jist gwine to &rsquo;ave a nice piece o&rsquo;
pork and greens, Mr. Prigg, would ee please to tak some,&rdquo;
said Mr. Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; answered Prigg; &ldquo;how very
strange, my favourite dish&mdash;if ever Mrs. Prigg is in doubt
about&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It be wery plain,&rdquo; said Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The plainer the better, my dear sir; as I always say to
my servants, if you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bumpkin; &ldquo;I be
&rsquo;ardly fit to wait on a gennleman like you.&nbsp; I
ain&rsquo;t &rsquo;ad time this morning to change my gown and
tidy up myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, my dear madam&mdash;don&rsquo;t, now; I adjure
you; make no apologies&mdash;it is not the dress&mdash;or
the&mdash;or the &mdash;, anything in fact, that makes us what we
are;&mdash;don&rsquo;t, if you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And here his profound sentiments died away again and were lost
to the world; and the worthy man, not long after, was discussing
his favourite dish with greedy relish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An when&rsquo;ll this &rsquo;ere thing be on, Mr.
Prigg, does thee think?&nbsp; It be a hell of a long
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom!&nbsp; Tom!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Bumpkin.&nbsp;
But Mr. <!-- page 320--><a name="page320"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 320</span>Prigg was too well bred and too much
occupied with his pork and greens to hear the very wayward
epithet of the Farmer Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; said the lawyer; &ldquo;quite so, it
is so difficult to tell when a case will come on.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re in the list to-day and gone to-morrow; a man the
other day was just worried as you have been; but mark this; at
the trial, Mr. Bumpkin, the jury gave that man a verdict for a
thousand pounds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at that, Nancy,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Bumpkin;
&ldquo;Will &rsquo;ee tak a little more pork, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Mr. Prigg, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
uncommonly good; some of your own feeding, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were that a pig case, Mr. Prigg, where the man got the
thousand pounds?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; answered Prigg, &ldquo;<i>was</i> it
a pig case?&rdquo;&nbsp; Here he put his finger to the side of
his nose.&nbsp; &ldquo;I really, at this moment, quite forget
whether it was or was not a pig case.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll trouble
you, Mrs. Bumpkin, for a little more greens, if you
please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I wur saying,&rdquo; said Bumpkin, &ldquo;jist as
thee comed in, where be I to lodge when I gooes to Lunnon
agin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, now, quite so&mdash;yes; and you must go in a day
or two.&nbsp; I expect we shall be on shortly.&nbsp; Now, let me
see, you don&rsquo;t like &lsquo;The Goose&rsquo;?&nbsp; A nice
respectable hostelry, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wunt &rsquo;ave un goo there, Mr. Prigg,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so&mdash;quite so.&nbsp; Now what I was thinking
was, suppose you took lodgings at some nice suburban place,
say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 321--><a name="page321"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
321</span>&ldquo;What pleace, sir?&rdquo; inquired Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us say Camden Town, for instance&mdash;nice healthy
neighbourhood and remarkably quiet.&nbsp; You could come every
morning by &rsquo;bus, or if you preferred it, by rail; and if by
rail, you could take a season ticket, which would be much
cheaper; a six months&rsquo; ticket, again, being cheaper than a
three months&rsquo; ticket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the name o&rsquo; Heaven, sir,&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs.
Bumpkin, &ldquo;be this &rsquo;ere thing gwine on for
ever?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Prigg smiled benignly, as much as to say, &ldquo;You
ladies are so impatient, so innocent of the business of
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me, Mr. Prigg, one need live to be as old
as thic there Mackthusaler to bring a law-suit
now-a-days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, look at that!&rdquo; broke in Joe,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s made master look forty year older
aready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it have, Joe,&rdquo; rejoined the mistress; &ldquo;I
wish it could be chucked up altogether.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Prigg benignantly shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;ye think I be gwine to give in to thic
sniggerin&rsquo; Snooks feller?&rdquo; asked Mr. Bumpkin.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Not if I knows it.&nbsp; Why thic feller goo
sniggerin&rsquo; along th&rsquo; street as though he&rsquo;d won;
and he &rsquo;ave told lots o&rsquo; people how he&rsquo;ll laugh
I out o&rsquo; Coourt&mdash;his counsel be gwine to laugh I out
o&rsquo; Coourt becors I be a country farmer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right can&rsquo;t be laughed out of Court, sir,&rdquo;
said the excellent Prigg, solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noa, noa, right bean&rsquo;t asheamed, goo where ur
wool.&nbsp; Upright and down-straight wur allays my motto.&nbsp;
I be a plain man, but I allays tried to act straight-forrerd, and
bean&rsquo;t asheamed o&rsquo; no man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This speech was a complete success: it was unanswerable.&nbsp;
<!-- page 322--><a name="page322"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
322</span>It fixed the lodgings at Camden Town.&nbsp; It stopped
Mrs. Bumpkin&rsquo;s impatience; diminished her apprehensions;
and apparently, lulled her misgivings.&nbsp; She was a gentle,
hard-working, loving wife.</p>
<p>And so all was settled.&nbsp; It was the month of April, and
it was confidently expected that by the end of July all would be
comfortably finished in time to get in the harvest.&nbsp; The
crops looked well; the meadows and clover-field promised a fair
crop, and the wheat and barley never looked better.</p>
<p>The following week found Mr. Bumpkin in his new lodgings at
Camden Town; and I verily believe, as Mr. Prigg very sagaciously
observed, if it had not been for the Judges going circuit,
<i>Bumpkin</i> v. <i>Snooks</i> would have been in the paper six
weeks earlier than it really was.&nbsp; But even lawsuits must
come on at last, be they never so tardy: and one day, in bustling
haste, Mr. Prigg&rsquo;s young man informed Mr. Bumpkin that a
consultation was actually fixed at his leader&rsquo;s chambers,
Garden Court, Temple, at seven o&rsquo;clock punctually the next
day.</p>
<p>Bumpkin was delighted: he was to be present at the express
wish of the leading counsel.&nbsp; So to Garden Court he went at
seven, with Mr. Prigg; and there sure enough was Mr. Dynamite,
his junior counsel.&nbsp; Mr. Catapult, Q.C., had not yet
arrived.&nbsp; So while they waited, Mr. Bumpkin had an
opportunity of looking about him; never in his life had he seen
so many books.&nbsp; There they were all over the walls; shelves
upon shelves.&nbsp; The chambers seemed built with books, and Mr.
Bumpkin raised his eyes with awe to the ceiling, expecting to see
books there.</p>
<p><!-- page 323--><a name="page323"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
323</span>&ldquo;What be all these &rsquo;ere books, sir?&rdquo;
he whispered to Prigg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are law books,&rdquo; answered the intelligent
Prigg; &ldquo;but these are only a few.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be a good dale o&rsquo; law,&rdquo; said
Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good deal too much,&rdquo; observed Mr. Dynamite,
with a smile; &ldquo;if we were to burn nine-tenths of the law
books we should have better law, eh, Mr. Prigg?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Prigg never contradicted counsel; and if Mr. Dynamite had
said it&rsquo;s a great pity that our libraries have so few
authorities, Prigg would have made the same answer, &ldquo;I
quite agree, quite so! quite so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Cats-&rsquo;is-name don&rsquo;t seem to
come,&rdquo; observed Bumpkin, after an hour and a half had
passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. <i>Catapult</i>, Mr. <i>Catapult</i>,&rdquo; said
Mr. Prigg; &ldquo;no, he doesn&rsquo;t seem to come.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And then he rang for the clerk, and the clerk came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think Mr. Catapult will return to-night?&rdquo;
inquired Prigg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he will,&rdquo; said the clerk,
looking at his watch; &ldquo;I am afraid not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beant much good to stop then,&rdquo; said Mr.
Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear not,&rdquo; observed the clerk, &ldquo;he has so
many engagements.&nbsp; Shall we fix another consultation, Mr.
Prigg?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please,&rdquo; said that gentleman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say half-past seven to-morrow, then.&nbsp; The case, I
find, is not in the paper to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so, quite so,&rdquo; returned Prigg,
&ldquo;half-past seven to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And thus the consultation was at an end and the parties went
their several ways.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">Mr. Bumpkin receives compliments from
distinguished persons.</p>
<p>One evening as Mr. Bumpkin was sitting in his little parlour,
ruminating, or as he termed it, &ldquo;rummaging&rdquo; in his
mind over many things, and especially wondering when the trial
would come on, Horatio, in breathless impatience, entered the
room.&nbsp; His excited and cheerful appearance indicated that
something of an unusually pleasant nature had occurred.&nbsp; A
strong intimacy had long been established between this boy and
Mr. Bumpkin, who regarded Horatio as a kind of legal prodigy; his
very hopes seemed centered in and inspired by this lad.&nbsp; He
seemed to be the guiding spirit and the flywheel of the whole
proceedings.&nbsp; Was Snooks to be pulverized? it must be under
Horatio&rsquo;s heel!</p>
<p>This legal stripling brought almost as much comfort as Mr.
Prigg himself; and it was quite a pleasure to hear the familiar
terms in which he spoke of the bigwigs of the profession.&nbsp;
He would say of McCannister, the Queen&rsquo;s Counsel, &ldquo;I
like Mac&rsquo;s style of putting a question, it&rsquo;s so soft
like&mdash;it goes down like a Pick-me-up.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he
would allude to Mr. Heavytop, Q.C., as Jack; to Mr. Bigpot as old
Kettledrum; to Mr. Swagger, Q.C., as Pat; to B. C. Windbag, Q.C.,
M.P., as B. C.&mdash;all which indicated to the mind of Mr.
Bumpkin the particularly <!-- page 326--><a
name="page326"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 326</span>intimate
terms upon which Horatio was with these celebrities.&nbsp; Nor
did his intimacy cease there: instead of speaking of the highest
legal official of the land in terms of respectful deference, as
&ldquo;my Lord High Chancellor,&rdquo; or &ldquo;my Lord
Allworthy,&rdquo;&mdash;he would say, in the most indifferent
manner &ldquo;Old Allworthy&rdquo; this, and &ldquo;Old
Allworthy,&rdquo; that; sometimes even, he ventured to call some
of Her Majesty&rsquo;s Judges by nick-names; an example which, I
trust, will not be followed by the Horatios of the future.&nbsp;
But I believe the pale boy, like his great namesake, was
fearless.&nbsp; It was a comfort to hear him denounce the
law&rsquo;s delay, and the terrible &ldquo;cumbersomeness&rdquo;
of legal proceedings: not that he did it in soothing language or
in happy phraseology: it was rather in a manner that led Mr.
Bumpkin to believe the young champion was standing up for his
particular rights; as if he had said to the authorities, whoever
they might be, &ldquo;Look here!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll have no more of
this: it&rsquo;s a shame and disgrace to this country that a
simple dispute between a couple of neighbours can&rsquo;t be
tried without months of quarrelling in Judges&rsquo; Chambers and
elsewhere; if you don&rsquo;t try this case before long
I&rsquo;ll see what can be done.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then there was
further consolation in the fact that Horatio declared that, in
his opinion, Tommy <i>Catpup</i>, Q.C., would knock Snooks into a
cocked hat, and that Snooks already looked very down in the
mouth.</p>
<p>On the evening at which I have arrived in my dream, when the
pale boy came in, Mr. Bumpkin inquired what was the matter: was
the case settled?&nbsp; Had Snooks paid the damages?&nbsp;
Nothing of the kind.&nbsp; Horatio&rsquo;s visit was of a
common-place nature.&nbsp; He had simply come to inform Mr.
Bumpkin that the Archbishop of <!-- page 327--><a
name="page327"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 327</span>Canterbury
had kindly sent him a couple of tickets for the reserved seats at
Canterbury Hall.</p>
<p>Mr. Bumpkin was disappointed.&nbsp; He cared nothing for
Archbishops.&nbsp; He was in hopes it had been something
better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wunt goo,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to go, I think,&rdquo; said Horatio; &ldquo;it
was very kind of old Archy to send em, and he wouldn&rsquo;t like
it if we didn&rsquo;t go: besides, he and the Rolls are great
chums.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rolls!&rdquo; said Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Master of the Rolls.&nbsp; I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder
if he aint got Archy to send em&mdash;don&rsquo;t you be a
fool.&nbsp; And another thing, Paganani&rsquo;s going to play the
farmyard on the fiddle to-night.&nbsp; Gemminey, ain&rsquo;t that
good!&nbsp; You hear the pigs squeak, and the bull roar, and the
old cock crow, and the sow grunt, and the horse
kick&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How the devil can thee hear a horse kick, unless he
kicks zummat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he does,&rdquo; said Horatio; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
just what he does do.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s go, I am sure you will
like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It beant one o&rsquo; these ere playhouse pleaces, be
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lor bless you,&rdquo; said Horatio,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s pews just the same as if you was in Church:
and the singing&rsquo;s beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No sarmon, I s&rsquo;pooase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not on week nights, but I&rsquo;ll tell you what there
is instead: a chap climbs up to the top of a high pole and stands
on his head for ten minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bumpkin, although a man who never went out of an evening,
could not resist the persuasions of his pale young friend.&nbsp;
He had never been to any place of amusement, except the Old
Bailey, since he had been in London; <!-- page 328--><a
name="page328"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 328</span>although he
had promised himself a treat to the Cattle Show, provided that
came on, which was very likely, as it only wanted five months to
it, before his case.</p>
<p>So they got on the top of a &rsquo;Bus and proceeded on their
way to Lambeth Palace; for the Canterbury Hall, as everyone
knows, is in that ancient pile.&nbsp; And truly, when they
arrived everything was astonishingly beautiful and
pleasing.&nbsp; Mr. Bumpkin was taken through the Picture
Gallery, which he enjoyed, although he would have liked to see
one or two like the Squire had got in his Hall, such as
&ldquo;Clinker,&rdquo; the prize bull; and &ldquo;Father
Tommy,&rdquo; the celebrated ram.&nbsp; But the Archbishop
probably had never taken a prize: not much of a breeder
maybe.</p>
<p>Now they entered the Hall amid strains of sweet, soft,
enchanting music.&nbsp; Never before had the soul of Bumpkin been
so enthralled: it was as if the region of fairyland had suddenly
burst upon his astonished view.&nbsp; In presence of all this
beauty, and this delicious cadence of sweet sounds, what a
common-place thing <i>Bumpkin</i> v. <i>Snooks</i> seemed!</p>
<p>Theirs was a very nice pew, commanding a full view of the
stage and all the angelic looking beings.&nbsp; And evidently our
friends were considered fashionable people, for many of the
audience looked round at them as they entered.&nbsp; So awed was
Mr. Bumpkin when he first sat down, that he wondered whether he
ought to look into his hat as the Squire did in Church; but,
resolving to be guided by Horatio, and seeing that the pale youth
did not even take his billycock off, but spread his elbows out on
the front ledge and clapped his hands with terrific vehemence,
and shouted &ldquo;Anchore&rdquo; as loudly as he <!-- page
329--><a name="page329"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
329</span>could, Mr. Bumpkin, in imitation, clapped his hands and
said &ldquo;Hooroar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was glorious.&nbsp; The waiter came and exchanged winks
with the pale boy, and brought some soda-and-brandy and a
cigar.&nbsp; Mr. Bumpkin wondered more and more.&nbsp; It was the
strangest place he had ever heard of.&nbsp; It seemed so strange
to have smoking and drinking.&nbsp; But then he knew there were
things occurring every day that the cleverest men could not
account for: not even Mr. Slater, the schoolmaster at Yokelton,
could account for them.</p>
<p>Just in front of the two friends was another pew, a very nice
one that was, and for some little time it was unoccupied.&nbsp;
Presently with a great rustling of silks and a great smell of
Jockey Club, and preceded by one of the servants of the
establishment, entered two beautiful and fashionably dressed
ladies of extremely quiet (except the Jockey Club) and retiring
demeanour.&nbsp; They could not but attract Mr. Bumpkin&rsquo;s
attention: they so reminded him of the Squire&rsquo;s daughters,
only they dressed much better.&nbsp; How he would like Nancy to
see them: she was very fond of beautiful gowns, was Nancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder who they be?&rdquo; whispered Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered Horatio;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask as soon as I get a chance.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
the Archbishop&rsquo;s pew; I believe they are his
daughters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t ur ha come wi em?&rdquo; said
Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He generally does, but I suppose he can&rsquo;t get
away to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment a waiter, or as Bumpkin called him a pew
opener, was passing, and Horatio whispered something in his ear,
his companion looking at him the while from the corner of his
eyes.</p>
<p><!-- page 330--><a name="page330"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
330</span>&ldquo;The one on the right,&rdquo; whispered the
waiter, untwisting the wire of a bottle of sodawater, &ldquo;is
the Countess Squeezem, and the other is Lady Flora, her
sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bumpkin nodded his head as much as to say, &ldquo;Just see
that: high life, that, if you like!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And really the Countess and Lady Flora were as quiet and
unassuming as if they had been the commonest bred people in the
world.</p>
<p>Now came forward on the stage a sweet young lady dressed in
yellow satin, with lovely red roses all down the front and one on
the left shoulder, greeted by a thunder of applause.&nbsp; Her
voice was thrilling: now it was at the back of the stage; now it
was just behind your ear; now in the ceiling.&nbsp; You
didn&rsquo;t know where to have it.&nbsp; After she had done,
Horatio said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of Nilsson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wery good! wery good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallo,&rdquo; says Horatio, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s Sims
Reeves.&nbsp; Bravo Sims! bravo Reeves!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve eered tell o&rsquo; he,&rdquo; says Bumpkin;
&ldquo;he be wery young, bean&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O,&rdquo; says Horatio, &ldquo;they paint up so; but
ain&rsquo;t he got a tenor&mdash;O gemminey crikery!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A tenner?&rdquo; says Bumpkin, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s thee
mean, ten pun a week?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O my eye!&rdquo; says the youth, &ldquo;he gets more
than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It be good wages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but it&rsquo;s nothing to what some of em
get,&rdquo; says Horatio; &ldquo;why if a man can play the fool
well he can get as much as the Prime Minister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, and thic Prime Minister can play the fool well <!--
page 331--><a name="page331"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
331</span>at times; it seem to me&mdash;they tooked the dooty of
whate and made un too chape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; asks Horatio of the
waiter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patti,&rdquo; says the waiter, &ldquo;at the express
wish of the Queen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bumpkin nods again, as though there was no end to the grandeur
of the company.</p>
<p>Then comes another no less celebrated, if Horatio was
correct.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s
Trebelli!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now this was too much for the absorbing powers of even a
Bumpkin.&nbsp; Horatio had carried it too far.&nbsp; Not that his
friend had ever heard of the great vocalist, but if you are
inclined for fun pray use names that will go down.&nbsp; Mr.
Bumpkin looked hard at Horatio&rsquo;s face, on which was just
the faintest trace of a smile.&nbsp; And then he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a name, <i>Bellie</i>! danged if I doan&rsquo;t
think thee be stickin it into I,&rdquo; and then he laughed and
repeated, &ldquo;thee be stickin it into I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for Pagannini!&rdquo; says Horatio; &ldquo;now
you&rsquo;ll hear something.&nbsp; By Jove, he&rsquo;ll show
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why I&rsquo;ve eerd tell o&rsquo; thic Piganiny when I
were a boy,&rdquo; says Bumpkin, &ldquo;used to play on one
leg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the man,&rdquo; says Horatio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this ere man got two legs, how can he be
Piganiny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about that,&rdquo; says
Horatio; &ldquo;what&rsquo;s it matter how many legs he&rsquo;s
got, just listen to that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why danged if that bean&rsquo;t as much like thic
Cochin Chiner cock o&rsquo; mine as ever I eered in my
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 332--><a name="page332"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
332</span>&ldquo;Told you so,&rdquo; says Horatio; &ldquo;but
keep quiet, you&rsquo;ll hear something presently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And sure enough he did: pig in the straw; sow in the stye;
bull in the meadow; sheep in the fold; everything was
perfect.</p>
<p>Never before had Mr. Bumpkin been so overpowered.&nbsp; He
never before knew what music was.&nbsp; Truly Piganiny was a
deserving man, and a clever one too.&nbsp; Mr. Bumpkin&rsquo;s
enthusiasm had carried him thus far, when to his great
satisfaction the Lady Flora looked round.&nbsp; It was very nice
of her, because it was as if she wished to know if Mr. Bumpkin
and his friend felt the same rapturous delight as she and her
sister.&nbsp; What a nice face Lady Flora&rsquo;s was!&nbsp; It
wasn&rsquo;t unlike the Squire&rsquo;s eldest
daughter&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Between that, perhaps, and the
Vicar&rsquo;s youngest daughter&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Then the Countess slightly turned round, her face wearing a
smile of great complaisance, and Mr. Bumpkin could have seen at
once that she was a person of great distinction even if he had
not been informed of her rank.&nbsp; Well, taken for all in all,
it was a night he would never forget, and his only feeling of
regret was that Mrs. Bumpkin was not present to share his
pleasure&mdash;the roar of that bull would have just pleased her;
it was so like Sampson.</p>
<p>And now the scene shifters were preparing for another
performance, and were adjusting ropes and fixing poles, and what
not, when, as Mr. Bumpkin was lost in profound meditation, up
rose from her seat the beautiful Lady Flora, and turning round
with a bewitching face, and assuming an air of inexpressible
simplicity, she exclaimed to Mr. Bumpkin in the sweetest of
voices: &ldquo;O you duck!&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 333--><a name="page333"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
333</span>Mr. Bumpkin started as if a cannon had exploded in his
face instead of a beautiful young lady.&nbsp; He blushed to the
deepest crimson, and then the lady Flora poured into him a volley
of her sweetiest prettiest laughter.&nbsp; Attacked thus so
suddenly and so effectively, what could he do?&nbsp; He felt
there must be some mistake, and that he ought to apologize.&nbsp;
But the Lady Flora gave him no time; leaning forward, she held
out her hand&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beg pardon,
m&rsquo;lady&mdash;thic&mdash;I&mdash;I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Countess rose and smiled upon Mr. Bumpkin, and said
she hoped he wouldn&rsquo;t mind; her sister was of such a
playful disposition.</p>
<p>The playful one here just touched Mr. Bumpkin under the chin
with her forefinger, and again said he was a &ldquo;<i>perfect
duck</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What be the manin&rsquo; o&rsquo; this?&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I be off; come on, sir.&nbsp; This be quite
enough for I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go like that,&rdquo; said Lady Flora.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, dear, dear, what a cruel man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a glass of wine,&rdquo; said the Countess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not one, Mr. Bumpkin!&rdquo; urged Lady Flora.</p>
<p>Mr. Bumpkin had risen, and was angry: he was startled at his
name being known: he looked to Horatio, hoping some explanation
might come; but the pale youth had his back to him, and was
preparing to leave the Hall.&nbsp; There were many curious eyes
looking at them, and there was much laughter.&nbsp; Mr.
Bumpkin&rsquo;s appearance would alone have been sufficient to
cause this: but his mind was to be farther enlightened as to the
meaning of this extraordinary scene; and it happened in this
wise.&nbsp; As he was proceeding between the rows of people,
followed closely by those illustrious members of the aristocracy,
the Countess and Lady <!-- page 334--><a name="page334"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 334</span>Flora; while the waiters grinned and
the people laughed, his eye caught sight of an object away over
the front seat, which formed a right angle with the one he had
been occupying; it was an object unattractive in itself but
which, under the circumstances, fixed and riveted his attention;
that object was Snooks, in the corner of the third row, with his
sawpit mouth on the broadest grin.</p>
<h2><!-- page 335--><a name="page335"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 335</span>CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">The trial.</p>
<p>Who shall describe the feelings of joy which animated the
breast of Mr. Bumpkin when at last, with the suddenness of
lightning, Mr. Prigg&rsquo;s clerk flashed into his little
parlour the intelligence, &ldquo;Case in paper; be at Court by
ten o&rsquo;clock; Bail Court.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such was the telegram
which Mr. Bumpkin got his landlady to read on that pleasant
evening towards the end of July.&nbsp; The far-seeing Prigg was
right.&nbsp; It would come on about the end of July.&nbsp; That
is what he had predicted.&nbsp; But it would not have been safe
for Mr. Bumpkin to be away from town for a single day.&nbsp; It
might have been in the paper at any moment; and here it was, just
as he was beginning to get tired of &ldquo;Camden Town and the
whole thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bumpkin put on a clean shirt, with a good stiff high
collar, which he had reserved from Mrs. Bumpkin&rsquo;s wash;
for, in his opinion, there was no stiffening in the London
starch, and no getting up like Mrs. Bumpkin&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He put
on his best neckerchief, and a bran new waistcoat which he had
bought for Sundays six years ago at the market town.&nbsp; He put
on his drab coat with the long tails, which he had worn on the
day of his marriage, and had kept for his best ever since; he put
on his velvety <!-- page 336--><a name="page336"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 336</span>looking corduroy trowsers and his
best lace-up watertight boots; and then, after a good breakfast,
put on his white beaver hat, took his ash-stick, and got into a
Westminster &lsquo;Bus.&nbsp; What a beautiful morning it
was!&nbsp; Just the morning for a law suit!&nbsp; Down he got at
Palace Yard, walked towards the spacious door of the old hall,
entered its shadowy precincts, and then, in my dream, I lost
sight of him as he mingled with the crowd.&nbsp; But I saw some
few moments after in the Bail Court enter, amidst profound
silence and with impressive dignity, Mr. Justice Stedfast.&nbsp;
Let me here inform the reader that if by any chance, say by
settlement, postponement or otherwise, the first case in the list
&ldquo;goes off,&rdquo; as it is called (from its bearing a
striking resemblance to the unexpected going off of a gun), and
the parties in the next case, taken by surprise, are not there at
the moment, that case goes off by being struck out; and very
often the next and the next, and so on to the end of the
list.&nbsp; Parties therefore should be ready, so as to prevent a
waste of time.&nbsp; The time of the Court is not to be wasted by
parties not being ready.&nbsp; Now, strangely enough, this is
what happened in the case of <i>Bumpkin</i> v.
<i>Snooks</i>.&nbsp; Being number eight, no one thought it would
be reached; and the leading counsel, and also the junior counsel
being engaged elsewhere; and Mr. Prigg and Mr. Prigg&rsquo;s
clerk not having arrived; and Mr. Bumpkin not knowing his way; at
five minutes after the sitting of the Court, so expeditious are
our legal proceedings, the celebrated case was actually reached,
and this is what took place:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are the parties ready?&rdquo; inquired his
Lordship.</p>
<p>Mr. Ricochet, Q.C., who appeared with Mr. Weasel for the
defendant, said he was ready for the defendant.</p>
<p><!-- page 337--><a name="page337"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
337</span>&ldquo;Call the plaintiff!&rdquo; said a voice.</p>
<p>Loud cries for Bumpkin, who was just pushing his way down the
passage outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does anyone answer?&rdquo; asked his lordship;
&ldquo;do you know if any gentleman is instructed, Mr.
Ricochet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not aware, my lud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand up and be sworn, gentlemen,&rdquo; says the
associate.&nbsp; Up stood the jury; and in less than half a
minute they found a verdict for the defendant, counterclaim being
abandoned, just as Mr. Bumpkin had pushed into Court.&nbsp; And
judgment is given.</p>
<p>The business having been thus got through, the Court rose and
went away.&nbsp; And then came in both counsel and Mr. Prigg and
Horatio; and great complaints were made of everybody except the
Judge, who couldn&rsquo;t help it.</p>
<p>But our administration of justice is not so inelastic that it
cannot adapt itself to a set of circumstances such as
these.&nbsp; It was only to make a few more affidavits, and to
appear before his lordship by counsel, and state the facts in a
calm and respectful manner, to obtain the necessary rectification
of the matter.&nbsp; All was explained and all forgiven.&nbsp;
<i>Bumpkin</i> v. <i>Snooks</i> was to be restored to the paper
upon payment of the costs of the day&mdash;a trifling matter,
amounting only to about eighteen pounds seventeen
shillings.&nbsp; But a severe admonition from the Bench
accompanied this act of grace: &ldquo;The Court cannot be kept
waiting,&rdquo; said his lordship; &ldquo;and it is necessary
that all suitors should know that if they are not here when their
cases are called on they will be struck out, or the party to the
cause who is here will be entitled to a verdict, if the
defendant; or to try his case in the other&rsquo;s absence, if he
be the plaintiff.&nbsp; It was idle to suppose <!-- page 338--><a
name="page338"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 338</span>that
parties could not be there in time: it was their business to be
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this every junior barrister nodded approvingly, and the
usher called silence.</p>
<p>Of course, the cause could not be in the paper again for some
time: they must suit Mr. Ricochet&rsquo;s convenience now: and
accordingly another period of waiting had to be endured.&nbsp;
Mr. Bumpkin was almost distracted, but his peace of mind was
restored by the worthy Prigg, who persuaded him that a most
laudable piece of good fortune had been brought about by his
intervention; and that was the preventing the wily Snooks from
keeping the verdict he had snatched.</p>
<p>What a small thing will sometimes comfort us!</p>
<p>Mr. Bumpkin was, indeed, a lucky man; for if his case had not
been in the paper when at last it was, it would have &ldquo;gone
over the Long Vacation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At length I saw Mr. Justice Pangloss, the eminent Chancery
Judge, take his seat in the Bail Court.&nbsp; He was an immense
case lawyer.&nbsp; He knew cases that had been tried in the
reigns of the Edwards and Henries.&nbsp; A pig case could not,
therefore, come amiss.</p>
<p>A case lawyer is like Moses and Sons; he can fit anybody, from
Chang down to a midget.&nbsp; But there is sometimes an
inconvenience in trying to fit an old precedent on to new
circumstances: and I am not unfrequently reminded of the boy
whose corduroy trousers were of the exact length, and looked
tolerable in front; but if you went round they stuck out a good
deal on the other side.&nbsp; He might grow to them, no doubt,
but it is a clumsy mode of tailoring after all.</p>
<p>Now Mr. Bumpkin, of course, could not be sure that his case
was &ldquo;coming on.&rdquo;&nbsp; All he knew was, that he <!--
page 339--><a name="page339"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
339</span>must avoid Snooks&rsquo; snatching another
verdict.&nbsp; He had been to great expense, and a commission had
actually been issued to take Joe&rsquo;s evidence while his
regiment was detained at Malta.&nbsp; Mr. Prigg had taken the
plaintiff into a crowd, and there had left him early in the
morning.</p>
<p>Mr. Bumpkin&rsquo;s appearance even in the densest crowd was
attractive, to say the least: and many and various were the
observations from time to time made by the vulgar roughs around
as to his personal appearance.&nbsp; His shirtcollar was greatly
praised, so was the beauty of his waistcoat: while I heard one
gentleman make an enquiry which showed he was desirous of
ascertaining what was the name of the distinguished firm which
had the honour of supplying him with hats.&nbsp; One said it was
Heath, he could tell by the brim; another that it was Cole, he
went by the polish; and the particular curl of the brim, which no
other hatter had ever succeeded in producing.&nbsp; While another
gentleman with one eye and half a nose protested that it was one
of Lincoln and Bennett&rsquo;s patent dynamite resisters on an
entirely new principle.</p>
<p>The subject of all these remarks listened as one in doubt as
to whether they were levelled at him or in any other
direction.&nbsp; He glanced at the many eyes turned upon him, and
heard the laughter that succeeded every new witticism.&nbsp; His
uncertainty as to whether he was &ldquo;the party eamed
at,&rdquo; heightened the amusement of the wits.</p>
<p>Now came a bolder and less mistakable allusion to his personal
appearance:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like Gladstone to see that, Jem; talk about

340</span>a collar! the Grand Old Man&rsquo;s
nowhere&mdash;he&rsquo;d better take to turndowns after
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the gentleman addressed; &ldquo;I
think this would settle him&mdash;is he liberal or tory, I
wonder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tory, you&rsquo;re sure&mdash;wotes for the Squoire,
I&rsquo;ll warrant.&nbsp; A small loaf and a big jail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bumpkin turned his eyes first towards one speaker and then
towards another without moving his head, as he thought:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Danged if I doan&rsquo;t bleeve thee means
I.&rdquo;&nbsp; But he wisely said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; said another, &ldquo;I wonder if
pigeon&rsquo;s milk is good for the complexion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Jem, &ldquo;it makes your nose red, and
makes the hair sprout out of the top of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here was a laugh all round, which made the Usher call out
silence; and the Judge said he would have the Court cleared if
order was not preserved.&nbsp; Then there was a loud shouting all
over the Court for &ldquo;Thomas Bumpkin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here I be!&rdquo; said Bumpkin, amid more
laughter&mdash;and especially of the wits around him.&nbsp; Then
a great bustling and hustling, and pushing and struggling took
place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Danged if that beant my case,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumpkin;
&ldquo;but it ain&rsquo;t my counsellor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make way for the plaintiff,&rdquo; shouted the Usher;
&ldquo;stand on one side&mdash;don&rsquo;t crowd up this
passage.&nbsp; This way, sir, make haste; the Court&rsquo;s
waiting for you, why do you keep the Court waiting in this
way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just going to strike your case out,&rdquo; said
the Judge, &ldquo;the public time can&rsquo;t be wasted in this
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bumpkin scrambled along through the crowd, and was <!-- page
341--><a name="page341"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
341</span>hustled into the witness-box.&nbsp; The Judge put up
his eye-glass, and looked at the plaintiff as though he was
hardly fit to bring an action in a Superior Court.&nbsp; Up went
the book into his hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take the book in your right
hand.&nbsp; Kiss the book; now attend and speak up&mdash;speak up
so that those gentlemen may hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why weren&rsquo;t you here before?&rdquo; asked the
Judge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wur, my lord?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you hear your learned counsel opening your
case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know it wur my case,&rdquo; said
Bumpkin, amid roars of laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder at that,&rdquo; said Mr. Ricochet,
looking at the jury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then,&rdquo; said the Judge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, then,&rdquo; said Mr. Silverspoon; for neither
of his own counsel was able to be present.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a farmer, I believe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the 29th of May, 18--; did the defendant come to
your farm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ur did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he buy a pig?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ur did not; but ur said he&rsquo;d be d---d if ur
wouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;ave un.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did he come and take it away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ur did; pulled un slick out of the sty; and when I
tried to stop un in the Lane, took un by main force?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Silverspoon sat down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the age of this pig, Mr. Bumpkin,&rdquo;
enquired the Judge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wur ten weeks old, your lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 342--><a name="page342"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
342</span>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there a calf case, Mr. Ricochet,
very similar to this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Mr. Justice Pangloss, &ldquo;it
was tried in the reign of James the First.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Ricochet, who knew nothing of the calf case, except what
his Lordship had told him, said he believed it was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this was anything,&rdquo; continued Mr. Ricochet,
&ldquo;upon the plaintiff&rsquo;s own showing it was a felony,
and the plaintiff should have prosecuted the defendant criminally
before having recourse to his civil remedy; that is laid down in
the sheep case reported in Walker&rsquo;s Trumpery
Cases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What volume of the Trumpery Cases is that, Mr.
Ricochet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six hundred and fifty, my lud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His Lordship writes it down.&nbsp; &ldquo;Page?&rdquo; says
his lordship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nineteen hundred and ninety-five, my lud; about the
middle of the book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judge calls to the Usher to bring the six hundred and fiftieth
volume of Walker&rsquo;s Trumpery Cases.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s a case before that,&rdquo; said his
lordship.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a case, if I recollect
rightly, about the time of Julius C&aelig;sar&mdash;the donkey
case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s on all fours with this,&rdquo; said Mr.
Ricochet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say, Mr. Silverspoon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Mr. Silverspoon proceeded to show that none of those
cases was on all fours with the present case; and a long and
interesting argument followed between the Bench and the
Bar.&nbsp; And it was said by those who were most competent to
judge, that Mr. Silverspoon quite <!-- page 343--><a
name="page343"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
343</span>distinguished himself for the wonderful erudition he
displayed in his knowledge of the donkey case, and several other
cases of four-footed beasts that were called to his attention by
Mr. Justice Pangloss.&nbsp; A perfect menagerie was
&ldquo;adduced.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Bumpkin meanwhile wondering
where he was, and what on earth they had all got to do with the
plain fact of Snooks taking his pig without paying for it.</p>
<p>At length, after four hours had been consumed in these learned
disquisitions, Mr. Justice Pangloss, reviewing the judgments of
the various eminent lawyers who had presided over the respective
cases in the several reigns, and after quoting many observations
of those eminent jurists, said that in order to save time he
would hold, for the purposes of to-day, that Mr. Bumpkin was
entitled to bring his action: but, of course, he would reserve
the point; he was by no means clear; he considered himself bound
by authority; and as the point was extremely important, and left
undecided after no less than twelve hundred years of argument on
the one side and the other, he thought it ought to be solemnly
settled.&nbsp; An unsettled state of the law was a very bad thing
in his lordship&rsquo;s opinion; especially in these modern
times, when it appeared to him that the public were clamouring
for further reform, and a still further simplification of legal
procedure.</p>
<p>This suited Mr. Ricochet exactly; he could not be said now to
have lost his case, even if the jury should find against
him.&nbsp; But he had yet to cut up Bumpkin in
cross-examination.&nbsp; The old trial was brought up against the
plaintiff; and every thing that could tend to discredit him was
asked.&nbsp; Mr. Ricochet, indeed, seemed to think that the art
of cross-examination consisted <!-- page 344--><a
name="page344"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 344</span>in bullying
a witness, and asking all sorts of questions tending to cast
reflections upon his character.&nbsp; He was especially great in
insinuating perjury; knowing that that is always open to a
counsel who has no other defence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you swear that?&rdquo; was asked at almost every
answer; sometimes prefaced by the warning, &ldquo;Be careful,
sir&mdash;be careful.&rdquo;&nbsp; If he could get hold of
anything against a witness&rsquo;s character, be it ever so
small, and at ever so remote a distance in the man&rsquo;s life,
he brought it out; and being a Queen&rsquo;s Counsel he did not
always receive the reproofs that would have crushed a stuff
gownsman into respectable behaviour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you charged with assaulting a female in the public
streets, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I worn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful, sir&mdash;she may be in Court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let her come forward then,&rdquo; said the courageous
Silverspoon, who was by no means wanting in tact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you be quiet, sir,&rdquo; retorted Ricochet.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Now Mr. Bumpkin, or whatever your name is, will you swear
she did not accuse you of assaulting her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She coomed oop, and it&rsquo;s my belief she wur in the
robbery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo Bumpkin!&rdquo; said one of the men who had
chaffed him.&nbsp; And the jury looked at one another in a manner
that showed approval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you swear, sir, you have never been in
trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I donnow what thee means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful, sir; you know what I mean perfectly
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Locust whispers to him, and he says:</p>
<p><!-- page 345--><a name="page345"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
345</span>&ldquo;O, you frequent Music Halls, don&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Donnow what thee means,&rdquo; says Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, you don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t you; will you swear
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful, sir.&nbsp; Were you at the Canterbury Hall
with two women, who passed as the Countess and Lady
Flora?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It be a lie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And thus every form of torture was ruthlessly employed, till
Mr. Bumpkin broke down under it, and cried like a child in the
witness-box.&nbsp; This awakened sympathy for him.&nbsp; There
had been much humour and much laughter; and Mr. Ricochet having
no knowledge of human nature, was not aware how closely allied
are laughter and tears; that in proportion as the jury had
laughed at the expense of Mr. Bumpkin they would sympathize with
his unhappy position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve worked hard,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for
sixty year, and let any man come forrard and say I&rsquo;ve
wronged man, ooman, or child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was a point for Bumpkin.&nbsp; Every one said,
&ldquo;Poor old man!&rdquo; and even his Lordship, who was
supposed to have no feeling, was quite sympathetic.&nbsp; Only
Mr. Ricochet was obtuse.&nbsp; He had no heart, and very little
skill, or he would have managed his case more adroitly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Badgering&rdquo; is not much use if you have no better
mode of winning your case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand down, Mr. Bumpkin,&rdquo; said his counsel, as
Mr. Ricochet resumed his seat amid the suppressed hisses of the
gallery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joseph Wurzel,&rdquo; said Mr. Silverspoon.</p>
<p>Joe appeared in the uniform of the Hussars.&nbsp; And he wore
a medal too.&nbsp; Mr. Ricochet had no sympathy <!-- page
346--><a name="page346"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
346</span>with heroes any more than he had with men of letters,
artists, or any other class of talent.&nbsp; He was a dry,
uncompromising, blunt, unfeeling lawyer, looking at justice as a
thimblerig looks at his pea; lift which thimble you may, he will
take care the pea shall not be found if he can help it.&nbsp; He
smiled a grim, inhuman smile at Bumpkin&rsquo;s tears, and
muttered that he was an &ldquo;unmanly milksop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe gave his evidence briefly and without hesitation.&nbsp;
Everyone could see he was speaking the truth; everybody but Mr.
Ricochet, who commenced his cross-examination by telling him to
be careful, and that he was upon his oath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful, sir;&rdquo; he repeated.</p>
<p>Joe looked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are on your oath, sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; Joe faced
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You deserted your master, did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Joe; &ldquo;I aint no
deserter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you enlisted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as that&rsquo;s desertion,&rdquo;
said Joe; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m here to speak for him now; and I
give my evidence at Malta, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you swear that, sir?&rdquo; enquired Mr.
Ricochet.&nbsp; &ldquo;Were you not with your master when the
young woman accused him of assaulting her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you enlist, then?&rdquo; enquired Mr.
Ricochet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cause I choose to,&rdquo; said Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, sir, upon your oath; I ask you, did you not enlist
because of this charge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I never heard on it till arter I was
listed.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 347--><a name="page347"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
347</span>&ldquo;When did you hear of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the trial at the Old Bailey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O,&rdquo; said the learned Q.C.; &ldquo;wait a minute,
you were there, were you?&nbsp; Were you there as a
witness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I warnt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you swear that?&rdquo; asked Ricochet, amid roars
of laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What were you there for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To hear the trial!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you were not called?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you mean on your oath, sir, to say that you had
enlisted at that time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now look at that,&rdquo; said Joe; &ldquo;the Sergeant
there enlisted me, and he knows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you had seen your master&rsquo;s watch many
times?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d seen it,&rdquo; said Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did not give evidence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I warnt called, and know&rsquo;d nothing about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been paid for coming here, I
suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a farden, and wouldn&rsquo;t take un; he bin a good
maister to me as ever lived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you left him.&nbsp; Now then, sir, be careful; do
you swear you heard Bumpkin say Snooks should not have the
pig?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been speaking to anyone about this case before
to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe thought a bit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful, sir, I warn you,&rdquo; says Ricochet.</p>
<p><!-- page 348--><a name="page348"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
348</span>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Joe; &ldquo;I have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so.&nbsp; When?&nbsp; To whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And here an air of triumph lit up the features of Mr.
Ricochet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afore I comed here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When! let&rsquo;s have it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Outside the Court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Bumpkin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; to that there Locust; he axed un&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind what he axed you;&rdquo; said Ricochet,
whose idea of humour consisted in the repetition of an illiterate
observation; and he sat down&mdash;as well he might&mdash;after
such an exhibition of the art of advocacy.</p>
<p>But on re-examination, it turned out that Mr. Locust had put
several questions to Joe with a view of securing his evidence
himself at a reasonable remuneration, and of contradicting Mr.
Bumpkin.</p>
<p>This caused the jury to look at one another with grave faces
and shake their heads.</p>
<p>Mr. Ricochet began and continued his speech in the same
common-place style as his cross-examination; abusing everyone on
the other side, especially that respectable solicitor, Mr. Prigg;
and endeavouring to undo his own bad performance with the witness
by a worse speech to the jury.&nbsp; What he was going to show,
and what he was going to prove, was wonderful; everybody who had
been called was guilty of perjury; everybody he was going to call
would be a paragon of all the virtues.&nbsp; He expatiated upon
the great common sense of the jury (as though they were fools),
relied on their sound judgment and denounced the conduct of Mr.
Bumpkin in the witness-box as a piece of artful acting, intended
to appeal to the weakness of the jury.&nbsp; But all was
useless.&nbsp; Snooks <!-- page 349--><a name="page349"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 349</span>made a sorry figure in the
box.&nbsp; He was too emphatic, too positive, too abusive.&nbsp;
Mr. Ricochet could not get over his own cross-examination.&nbsp;
The ridiculous counterclaim with its pettifogging innuendoes
vanished before that common sense of the jury to which Mr.
Ricochet so dryly appealed.&nbsp; The edifice erected by the
modern pleader&rsquo;s subtle craftiness was unsubstantial as the
icy patterns on the window-pane, which a single breath can
dissipate.&nbsp; And yet these ingenious contrivances were
sufficient to give an unimportant case an appearance of
substantiality which it otherwise would not have possessed.</p>
<p>The jury, after a most elaborate charge from Mr. Justice
Pangloss, who went through the cases of the last 900 years in the
most careful manner, returned a verdict for the plaintiff with
twenty-five pounds damages.&nbsp; The learned Judge did not give
judgment, inasmuch as there were points of law to be
argued.&nbsp; Mr. Bumpkin, although he had won his case so far as
the verdict was concerned, did not look by any means
triumphant.&nbsp; He had undergone so much anxiety and misery,
that he felt more like a man who had escaped a great danger than
one who had accomplished a great achievement.</p>
<p>Snooks&rsquo; mouth, during the badgering of the witnesses,
which was intended for cross-examination was quite a study for an
artist or a physiologist.&nbsp; When he thought a witness was
going to be caught, the orifice took the form of a gothic window
in a ruinous condition.&nbsp; When he imagined the witness had
slipped out of the trap laid for him, it stretched horizontally,
and resembled a baker&rsquo;s oven.&nbsp; He was of too coarse a
nature to suspect that his own counsel had damaged his case, and
believed the result of the trial to have been due to the <!--
page 350--><a name="page350"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
350</span>plaintiff&rsquo;s &ldquo;snivelling.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
left the Court with a melancholy downcast look, and his only
chance of happiness hereafter in this life seemed now to be in
proportion to his power of making Mr. Bumpkin miserable.&nbsp;
Mr. Locust was not behind in his advice on their future course;
and, after joining his client in the hall, at once pointed out
the utterly absurd conclusion at which the jury had arrived;
declared that there must be friends of the plaintiff among them,
and that Mr. Ricochet would take the earliest opportunity of
moving for a new trial; a piece of information which quite lit up
the coarse features of his client, as a breath of air will bring
a passing glow to the mouldering embers of an ash-heap on a dark
night.</p>
<h2><!-- page 351--><a name="page351"></a><span

<p class="gutsumm">Motion for rule nisi, in which is displayed
much learning, ancient and modern.</p>
<p>On the following day there was a great array of judicial
talent and judicial dignity sitting in what is called
&ldquo;Banco,&rdquo; not to be in any way confounded with
&ldquo;Sancho;&rdquo; the two words are totally distinct both as
to their meaning and etymology.&nbsp; In the centre of the Bench
sat Mr. Justice Doughty, one of the clearest heads perhaps that
ever enveloped itself in horsehair.&nbsp; On his right was Mr.
Justice Pangloss, and on his left Mr. Justice Technical.</p>
<p>Then arose from the Queen&rsquo;s Counsel row, Mr. Ricochet to
apply for a rule <i>nisi</i> for a new trial in the cause of
<i>Bumpkin</i> v. <i>Snooks</i> which was tried yesterday before
Mr. Justice Pangloss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before me?&rdquo; says Mr. Justice Pangloss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my lud,&rdquo; says Mr. Ricochet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; enquired the learned Judge,
turning over his notes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, quite, my lud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; says his lordship: &ldquo;what do you say
the name of the case was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bumpkin</i> against <i>Snooks</i>, my lud,&rdquo;
says Mr. Ricochet, Q.C.</p>
<p><!-- page 352--><a name="page352"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
352</span>&ldquo;Coots; what was it,&mdash;a Bill of
Exchange?&rdquo; asks his lordship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snooks, my lud, Snooks;&rdquo; says Mr. Ricochet,
&ldquo;with the greatest deference, my lud, his name is spelt
with an S.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judge, still turning over his book from end to end calls to
his clerk, and addressing Mr. Ricochet, says: &ldquo;When do you
say it was tried, Mr. Ricochet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yesterday, my lud; with great submission, my lud, I
overheard your ludship say Coots.&nbsp; Snooks, my
lud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then all the Judges cried &ldquo;Snooks!&rdquo; as if it had
been a puzzle or a conundrum at a family Christmas party, and
they had all guessed it at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring me the book for this term,&rdquo; said the Judge
sharply to his clerk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the name of the plaintiff?&rdquo; enquired Mr.
Justice Doughty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bumpkin, my lud,&rdquo; said Mr. Ricochet, &ldquo;with
great deference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Pumpkin, so it was,&rdquo; said the presiding
Judge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With great submission, my lud, Bumpkin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bumpkin, my lud;&rdquo; and then all the Judges&rsquo;
cried &ldquo;Bumpkin!&rdquo; as pleased as the followers of
Columbus when they discovered America.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, here it is,&rdquo; said Mr. Justice Pangloss,
passing his forefinger slowly along the page; &ldquo;the name of
the case you refer to, Mr. Ricochet, is <i>Bumpkin</i> v.
<i>Snooks</i>, not <i>Coots</i> v. <i>Pumpkin</i>, and it was
tried before me and a special jury on the twenty-eighth of July
of the present year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my lud, with all submission.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 353--><a name="page353"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
353</span>&ldquo;Why, that was yesterday,&rdquo; said Mr. Justice
Pangloss.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why did you not say so; I was referring to
last year&rsquo;s book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With all deference, my lud&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, never mind, Mr. Ricochet; let us get
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you move for?&rdquo; asked Mr. Justice
Doughty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A new trial, my lud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A new trial&mdash;yes&mdash;?&nbsp; Which way was the
verdict, Mr. Ricochet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Verdict for the plaintiff, my lud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And whom do you appear for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am for the defendant, my lud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O! you&rsquo;re for the defendant.&nbsp; Stop&mdash;let
me have my note correct.&nbsp; I find it always of great
assistance when the rule comes on to be argued.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t say you&rsquo;re going to have a rule.&nbsp; I must
know a little more of the case before we grant a rule.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If your ludship pleases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not gather what his lordship intended to say when he
made the observations recorded, and can only regret that his
lordship should have broken off so abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ground do you move upon, Mr. Ricochet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Ricochet said, &ldquo;The usual grounds, my lud; that is
to say, that the verdict was against the weight of
evidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop a minute,&rdquo; said Mr. Justice Doughty;
&ldquo;let me have my note correct, &lsquo;against the weight of
evidence,&rsquo; Mr. Ricochet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Misdirection, my lud&mdash;with all respect to Mr.
Justice Pangloss&mdash;and wrongful admission of
evidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 354--><a name="page354"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
354</span>&ldquo;What was the action for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now this was a question that no man living had been able to
answer yet.&nbsp; What was in the pleadings, that is, the pattern
of the lawyer&rsquo;s net, was visible enough; but as regards
merits, I predict with the greatest confidence, that no man will
ever be able to discover what the action of <i>Bumpkin</i> versus
<i>Snooks</i> was about.&nbsp; But it speaks wonders for the
elasticity of our system of jurisprudence and the ingenuity of
our lawyers that such a case could be <i>invented</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trespass,&rdquo; said Ricochet, &ldquo;was one
paragraph; then there was assault and battery; breach of contract
in not accepting a pig at the price agreed; trespass in seizing
the pig without paying for it; and then, my lud, there were the
usual money counts, as they used to be called, to which the
defendant pleaded, among other pleas, a right of way; an
easement; leave and license; a right to take the pig; that the
pig was the property of the defendant, and various other
matters.&nbsp; Then, my lud, there was a counter-claim for
slander, for assault and battery; for loss of profit which would
have been made if the pig had been delivered according to
contract; breach of contract for the non-delivery of the
pig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Doughty: &ldquo;This was pig-iron, I
suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two other Judges fell back, shaking their sides with
laughter; and then forcibly thrust their hands against their hips
which made their tippets stick out very much, and gave them a
dignified and imposing appearance.&nbsp; Then, seeing the Judges
laugh, all the bar laughed, and all the ushers laughed, and all
the public laughed.&nbsp; The mistake, however, was a very easy
one to fall into, and when Mr. Justice Doughty, who was an <!--
page 355--><a name="page355"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
355</span>exceedingly good-tempered man, saw the mistake he had
made, he laughed as much as any man, and even caused greater
laughter still by good-humouredly and wittily observing that he
supposed somebody must be a pigheaded man.&nbsp; To which Mr.
Ricochet laughingly replied, that he believed the plaintiff was a
very pigheaded man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Mr. Justice Pangloss, &ldquo;have you
considered what Vinnius in his &lsquo;Commentary on Urban
Servitudes&rsquo; says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Ricochet said, &ldquo;Hem!&rdquo; and that was the very
best answer he could make to the learned Pangloss, and if he only
continues to answer in that manner he&rsquo;ll get any rule he
likes to apply for&mdash;(no, not the Rule of Three,
perhaps).</p>
<p>So Mr. Justice Pangloss went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are, as Gale says, &lsquo;two classes of
easements distinctly recognised by the Civil
Law&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hem!&rdquo; said Ricochet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Under the head of &ldquo;Urban
Servitudes&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ricochet: &ldquo;Hem!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That a man,&rsquo; (continued Mr. Justice
Pangloss), &lsquo;shall receive upon his house or land the
<i>flumen</i> or <i>stillicidium</i> of his
neighbour&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hem!&rdquo; coughed Mr. Ricochet, in a very high key; I
verily believe in imitation of that wonderful comedian, J. C.
Clarke.</p>
<p>Then Mr. Justice Pangloss proceeded, to the admiration of the
whole Bar:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The difference,&rsquo; says Vinnius, in his
Commentary on this passage, between the <i>flumen</i> and the
<i>stillicidium</i> is this&mdash;the latter is the rain falling
from the roof by drops (<i>guttatim et
stillatim</i>).&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 356--><a name="page356"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
356</span>&ldquo;Hem!&rdquo; from the whole Bar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The <i>flumen</i>&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Mr. Justice Doughty, &ldquo;you
are entitled to a rule on that point, Mr. Ricochet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Mr. Justice Technical whispered, and I heard Mr. Justice
Doughty say the principle was the same, although there might be
some difference of opinion about the facts, which could be argued
hereafter.&nbsp; &ldquo;But what is the misreception of evidence,
Mr. Ricochet?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t quite see that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With all submission, my lud, evidence was admitted of
what the solicitor for the defendant said to the
plaintiff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute, let me see how that stands,&rdquo; said
Mr. Justice Doughty; &ldquo;the solicitor for the defendant said
something to the plaintiff, I don&rsquo;t quite follow
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Technical observed that it was quite clear that
what is said by the solicitor of one party to the solicitor of
another party is not evidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O,&rdquo; said the learned Pangloss, &ldquo;so far back
as the time of Justinian it was laid down&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that being so,&rdquo; said the eminent Chancery
Judge, Mr. Justice Technical, &ldquo;I should go so far as to
say, that what the solicitor of one party says to the client
stands upon the same footing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; said Mr. Ricochet</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you are entitled to a rule on that
point,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Justice Doughty, &ldquo;although my
brother Pangloss seems to entertain some doubt as to whether
there was any such evidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, my lud, with all submission, with the greatest
possible deference and respect to the learned Judge, I <!-- page
357--><a name="page357"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
357</span>assure your ludship that it was so, for I have a note
of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was about to say,&rdquo; continued Mr. Justice
Doughty, &ldquo;as my brother Pangloss says, it may have been
given while he was considering a point in Justinian.&nbsp; What
is the misdirection?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, my lud, the misdirection was, I venture respectfully
and deferentially to submit, and with the utmost deference to the
learned Judge, in his lordship&rsquo;s telling the jury that if
they found that the right of way which the defendant set up in
his answer to the trespass, or easement&mdash;but perhaps, my
lud, I had better read from the short-hand writer&rsquo;s notes
of his ludship&rsquo;s summing-up.&nbsp; This is it, my lud, his
ludship said: &lsquo;In an action for stopping of his
<i>ancient</i> lights &mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Mr. Justice Doughty, &ldquo;<i>did he
black the plaintiff&rsquo;s eyes</i>, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my lud,&rdquo; said Mr. Ricochet, &ldquo;that was
never alleged or suggested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only used it by way of illustration,&rdquo; said Mr.
Justice Pangloss.</p>
<p>Then their lordships consulted together, and after about
three-quarters of an hour&rsquo;s conversation the learned Mr.
Justice Doughty said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can take a rule, Mr. Ricochet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On all points, my lud, if your ludships
please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be more satisfactory,&rdquo; said his lordship,
&ldquo;and then we shall see what there is in it.&nbsp; At
present, I must confess, I don&rsquo;t understand anything about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I saw that what there was really in it was very much like
what there is in a kaleidoscope, odds and ends, which form all
sorts of combinations when you twist and turn them about in the
dark tube of a &ldquo;legal argument.&rdquo;&nbsp; <!-- page
358--><a name="page358"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
358</span>And so poor Bumpkin was deprived of the fruit of his
victory.&nbsp; Truly the law is very expeditious.&nbsp; Before
Bumpkin had got home with the cheerful intelligence that he had
won, the wind had changed and was setting in fearfully from the
north-east.&nbsp; Juries may find as many facts as they like, but
the Court applies the law to them; and law is like gunpowder in
its operation upon them,&mdash;twists them out of all
recognisable shape.&nbsp; It is very difficult in a Court of law
to get over &ldquo;<i>guttatims</i>&rdquo; and
&ldquo;<i>stillatims</i>,&rdquo; even in an action for the price
of a pig.</p>
<h2><!-- page 359--><a name="page359"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 359</span>CHAPTER XXXVII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Mr. Bumpkin is congratulated by his neighbours
and friends in the market place and sells his corn.</p>
<p>What a lovely peace there was again over the farm!&nbsp; It
was true Mr. Bumpkin had not obtained as large a measure of
damages as his solicitor had led him to anticipate, but he was
triumphant, and that over a man like Snooks was something.&nbsp;
So the damages were forgotten beneath that peaceful August
sky.&nbsp; How bright the corn looked!&nbsp; There was not a
particle of &ldquo;smut&rdquo; in the whole field.&nbsp; And it
was a good breadth of wheat this year for Southwood Farm.&nbsp;
The barley too, was evidently fit for malting, and would be sure
to fetch a decent price: especially as they seemed to say there
was not much barley this year that was quite up to the mark for
malting.&nbsp; The swedes, too, were coming on apace, and a
little rain by and by would make them swell considerably.&nbsp;
So everything looked exceedingly prosperous, except perhaps the
stock.&nbsp; There certainly were not so many pigs.&nbsp; Out of
a stye of eleven there was only one left.&nbsp; The sow was
nowhere to be seen.&nbsp; She had been sold, it appeared, so no
more were to be expected from that quarter.&nbsp; When Mr.
Bumpkin asked where &ldquo;old Jack&rdquo; was (that was the
donkey), he was informed that &ldquo;the man&rdquo; had fetched
it.&nbsp; &ldquo;The man&rdquo; <!-- page 360--><a
name="page360"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 360</span>it appeared
was always fetching something.&nbsp; Yesterday it was pigs; the
day before it was ducks; the day before that it was geese; and
about a week ago it was a stack of this year&rsquo;s hay: a stack
of very prime clover indeed.&nbsp; Then &ldquo;the man&rdquo;
took a fancy to some cheeses which Mrs. Bumpkin had in the dairy,
some of her very finest make.&nbsp; She remonstrated, but
&ldquo;the man&rdquo; was peremptory.&nbsp; But what most
surprised Mr. Bumpkin, and drew tears from Mrs. Bumpkin&rsquo;s
eyes, was when the successful litigant enquired how the bull
was.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bumpkin had invented many plans with a view to
&ldquo;breaking this out&rdquo; to her husband: and now that the
time had come every plan was a failure.&nbsp; The tears betrayed
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, be he dead?&rdquo; enquired Mr. Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, no, Tom&mdash;no, no&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man!&nbsp; The devil&rsquo;s in thic man, who be
he?&nbsp; Where do ur come from?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll bring an action
agin him as sure&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s alive or shoot un dead wi my
gun;&rdquo; here Mr. Bumpkin, in a great rage, got up and went to
the beam which ran across the kitchen ceiling, and formed what is
called the roof-tree of the house, by the side of which the gun
was suspended by two loops.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, Tom, don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t&mdash;we
have never wronged any one yet, and don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I wool,&rdquo; said Bumpkin; &ldquo;what! be I to
be stripped naaked and not fight for th&rsquo; cloathes&mdash;who
be thic feller as took the bull?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Bumpkin was holding her apron to her eyes, and for a long
while could say nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who be he, Nancy?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 361--><a name="page361"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
361</span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Tom&mdash;but he held a
paper in his hand writ all over as close as the stubble-rows in
the field, and he said thee had signed un.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord! lord!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Bumpkin, and then sat
down on the settle and looked at the fire as though it threw a
light over his past actions.&nbsp; He couldn&rsquo;t speak for a
long time, not till Mrs. Bumpkin went up to him and laid her hand
upon his shoulder, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom!&nbsp; Tom! thee ha winned the case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye,&rdquo; said Bumpkin, starting up as from a
reverie.&nbsp; &ldquo;I ha winned, Nancy.&nbsp; I ha beat thic
there Snooks; ur wont snigger now when ur gooes by&mdash;lor,
lor,&mdash;our counsellor put it into un straight,
Nancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did ur, Tom?&mdash;well, I be proud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Bumpkin, &ldquo;and what d&rsquo;ye
think?&mdash;it wornt our counsellor, that is the Queen&rsquo;s
Counsellor nuther; he wornt there although I paid un, but I
spoase he&rsquo;ll gie up the money, Nancy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were it much, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farty guineas!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farty guineas, Tom!&nbsp; Why, it wur enough to set up
housekeepin wi&mdash;and thee only winned twenty-five, Tom; why
thic winnin were a heavy loss I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, lookee ere,&rdquo; said Bumpkin; &ldquo;I oughter
had five undered, as Laryer Prigg said, our case were that good,
but lor it baint sartain: gie I a little gin and water,
Nancy&mdash;thee ain&rsquo;t asked I to have a drap since I bin
oame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lor, Tom, thee knows I be all for thee, and that all be
thine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It beant much, it strikes me; lor, lor, whatever shall
us do wirout pigs and sheep, and wirout thic bull.&nbsp; I be fit
to cry, Nancy, although I winned the case.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 362--><a name="page362"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
362</span>Tom had his gin and water and smoked his pipe, and went
to bed and dreamed of all that had taken place.&nbsp; He rose
with the lark and went into the fields and enjoyed once again the
fresh morning air, and the sweet scent of the new hayrick in the
yard; and, without regarding it, the song of the lark as it shot
heavenward and poured down its stream of glad music: but there
was amidst all a sadness of spirit and a feeling of
desolation.&nbsp; It was not like the old times when everything
seemed to welcome him about the farm wherever he went.&nbsp; The
work of &ldquo;the man&rdquo; was everywhere.&nbsp; But the
harvest was got in, and a plentiful harvest it was: the corn was
threshed, and one day Mr. Bumpkin went to market with his little
bags of samples of the newly-housed grain.&nbsp; Everybody was
glad to see him, for he was known everywhere as a regular upright
and down-straight man.&nbsp; Every farmer and every corn-dealer
and cattle-dealer congratulated him in his homely way on his
success.&nbsp; They looked at his samples and acknowledged they
were very bright and weighty.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never liked that
Snooks feller,&rdquo; was the general cry, and at the
farmers&rsquo; ordinary, which was held every market day at the
&ldquo;Plough,&rdquo; every one who knew Bumpkin shook hands and
wished him well, and after dinner, before they broke up, Farmer
Gosling proposed his health, and said how proud he &ldquo;were
that his old neighbour had in the beautiful words o&rsquo; the
National Anthem, &lsquo;confounded their politicks&rsquo;: and he
hoped that the backbone o&rsquo; old England, which were the
farmers, wornt gwine to be broked jist yet awhile.&nbsp; Farmin
might be bad, but yet wi little cheaper rents and a good deal
cheaper rates and taxes, there&rsquo;d be good farmin and good
farmers in England yit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now this speech, I saw in my dream, brought down the <!-- page
363--><a name="page363"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
363</span>house.&nbsp; Everyone said it was more to the point
than the half-mile speeches which took up so much of the
newspapers to the exclusion of murders, burglaries and
divorces.&nbsp; And in truth, now I come to look at it in my
waking moments, I respectfully commend it to our legislators, or
what is better, to their constituencies, as embodying on this
subject both the principles of true conservatism and true
liberalism: and I don&rsquo;t see what the most exacting of
politicians can require more than that.</p>
<p>Mr. Bumpkin made a suitable reply&mdash;that is to say,
&ldquo;he wur mighty proud o&rsquo; their
neighbourliness&mdash;he wur a plaain man, as had made his own
way in the world, or leastwise tried to do un by ard work and
uprightedness and downstraightedness; tried to be straight
forrerd, and nobody as he knowed of could ax un for a
shillin&rsquo;.&nbsp; But,&rdquo; he added: &ldquo;I be praisin
oop myself, neighbours, I be afeard, and I doant wish to do thic,
only to put I straaight afore thee.&nbsp; I beant dead yit, and I
hope we shall all be friends and neighbours, and meet many moore
times at this ornary together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so, delighted with one another, after a glass or two, and
a song or two, the party broke up, all going to their several
farms.&nbsp; Mr. Bumpkin was particularly well pleased, for he
had sold twenty quarters of wheat at forty-nine shillings a
quarter; which, as times went, was a very considerable increase,
showing the excellent quality of the samples.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, however, it must be told, that when Bumpkin
reached his quiet farm, a strange and sad scene presented
itself.&nbsp; Evidences of &ldquo;<i>the man</i>&rdquo; were in
all directions.&nbsp; He had been at work while Mr. Bumpkin in
his convivial moments was protesting that he did not <!-- page
364--><a name="page364"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
364</span>owe anyone a shilling.&nbsp; Alas! how little the best
of as know how much we owe!</p>
<p>Mrs. Bumpkin, who had borne up like a true woman through all
the troubles that had come upon her home,&mdash;borne up for his
sake, hoping for better days, and knowing nothing of the terrible
net that had been spread around them by the wily fowler, at
length gave way, as she saw &ldquo;the man&rdquo; loading his
cart with her husband&rsquo;s wheat; the wheat he had gone that
day to sell.&nbsp; Bitterly she wrung her hands, and begged him
to spare her husband that last infliction.&nbsp; Was there
anything that she could do or give to save him this blow?&nbsp;
No, no; the man was obstinate in the performance of his duty;
&ldquo;right was right, and wrong was no man&rsquo;s
right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So when Mr. Bumpkin returned, the greater part of his wheat
was gone, and the rest was being loaded.&nbsp; The beautiful rick
of hay too, which had not yet ceased to give out the fresh scent
that a new rick yields, were being cut and bound into
trusses.</p>
<p>Poor Tom was fairly beside himself, but Mrs. Bumpkin had taken
the precaution to hide the gun and the powder-flask, for she
could not tell what her husband might do in his
distraction.&nbsp; Possibly she was right.&nbsp; Tom&rsquo;s rage
knew no bounds.&nbsp; Youth itself seemed to be restored in the
strength of his fury.&nbsp; He saw dimly the men standing around
looking on; he saw, as in a dream, the man cutting on the rick,
and he uttered incoherent sentences which those only understood
who were accustomed to his provincial accent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom, Tom,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bumpkin, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
be in a rage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who be thic feller on my rick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beant any more a feller nor thee, Maister Boompkin;
it aint thy rick nuther.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 365--><a name="page365"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
365</span>&ldquo;Then in the name of h&mdash;, whose be
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It be Maister Skinalive&rsquo;s; thee can&rsquo;t have
t&rsquo; cake an eat un; thee sowled it to un.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It be a lie, a --- lie; come down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noa, noa, I beant coomin doon till I coot all t&rsquo;
hay; it be good hay an all, as sweet as a noot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is thy master?&rdquo; enquired Mrs. Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dooant rightly knoo, missus, where ur be; but I think
if thee could see un, he&rsquo;d poot it right if thee wanted
time loike, and so on, for he be a kind-hearted man
enoo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we find un, do ur think?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If thee do, missus, it wur moor un I bin able to do for
the last three moonths.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find some un,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumpkin;
&ldquo;here, goo and fetch a pleeceman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was said to a small boy who did the bird-minding, and was
now looking on with his mouth wide open, and his eyes actually
shedding tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, fetch a pleeceman an all,&rdquo; said the man,
thrusting the big hay-knife down into the centre of the rick;
&ldquo;but take a soop o&rsquo; cyder, maister; I dessay thee
feels a bit out o&rsquo; sorts loike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thee darn thief; it be my cyder, too, I&rsquo;ve a
notion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can it be thine, maister, when thee ha&rsquo;
sowled un?&rdquo; said the man with his unanswerable logic:
&ldquo;haw! haw! haw!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Bumpkin held her husband&rsquo;s hand, and tried her
hardest to keep him from using violence towards the man.&nbsp;
She felt the convulsive twitches of his strong muscles, and the
inward struggle that was shaking his stalwart frame.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Come away, Tom; come away; let <!-- page 366--><a
name="page366"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 366</span>un do as
they like, we&rsquo;ll have them as will see us righted
yet.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s law for un, surely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It beant no use to kick, maister,&rdquo; said the man,
again ramming the knife down into the rick as though he were
cutting Mr. Bumpkin himself in half, and were talking to him the
while; &ldquo;it beant no use to kick, maister.&nbsp; Here thee
be; thee owes the man the money, and can&rsquo;t pay, so ur does
this out of kindness to prevent thee being sowled oop
loike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here be the pleeceman,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bumpkin.</p>
<p>Mr. Bumpkin turned suddenly, and shouted, &ldquo;Tak thic
thief into custody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The policeman, albeit a country constable, was a very sensible
man; and seeing how matters stood, he very wisely set himself to
the better task of taking Mr. Bumpkin into custody without
appearing to do so, and without Mr. Bumpkin knowing it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if so be as you will come
indoors, Mr. Bumpkin, I think we can put our heads together and
see what can be done in this &rsquo;ere case; if it&rsquo;s
stealing let him steal, and I&rsquo;ll have him nicely; but if it
ain&rsquo;t stealing, then I woant have him at all.&rdquo;&nbsp;
(A pause.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;For why?&rdquo;&nbsp; (A pause.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because the law gives you other remedies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That be right, pleeceman,&rdquo; said Bumpkin;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll goo wi&rsquo; thee.&nbsp; Now then, Nancy,
let&rsquo;s goo; and look &rsquo;ere, thee thief, I&rsquo;ll
ha&rsquo; thee in th&rsquo; jail yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man grinned with a mouth that seemed to have been cut with
his own hay-knife, so large was it, and went on with his work,
merely saying: &ldquo;I dooant charge thee nothin for
cootin&rsquo; nor yet for bindin, maister; I does it all free
graatis, loike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thee d--- thief, thee&rsquo;ll be paid.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 367--><a name="page367"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
367</span>So they went in, and the policeman was quite a
comforter to the poor old man.&nbsp; He talked to him about what
the law was on this point and that point, and how a trespass was
one thing, and a breach of the peace another; and how he
mustn&rsquo;t take a man up for felony just because somebody
charged him: otherwise, the man on the rick might have charged
Mr. Bumpkin, and so on; till he got the old man into quite a
discussion on legal points.&nbsp; But meanwhile he had given him
another piece of advice, which was also much to his credit, and
that was to send to his solicitor, Mr. Prigg.&nbsp; Mr. Prigg was
accordingly sent for; but, like most good men, was very
scarce.&nbsp; Nowhere could Mr. Prigg be found.&nbsp; But it was
well known, for it was advertised everywhere on large bills, that
the excellent gentleman would take the chair at a meeting, to be
held in the schoolroom in the evening, for the propagation of
Christianity among the Jews.&nbsp; The policeman would be on duty
at that meeting, and he would be sure to see Mr. Prigg, and tell
him Mr. Bumpkin was very desirous to see him as early as possible
on the following day.&nbsp; Mr. Bumpkin was thankful, and to some
extent pacified.&nbsp; As the policeman wished them goodnight,
Mrs. Bumpkin accompanied him to the door, and begged, if he
wouldn&rsquo;t mind, that he would look in to-morrow, for he
seemed a kind of protection for them.</p>
<p>It was about three in the afternoon of the following day when
good Mr. Prigg drove up to Mr. Bumpkin&rsquo;s door; he drove up
with the mare that had been Mr. Bumpkin&rsquo;s cow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here he be,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bumpkin; and if Mr. Prigg
had been an angel from heaven, his presence could not have been
more welcome.&nbsp; Oh, what sunshine he seemed to bring!&nbsp;
Was it a rainbow round his face, or was it only <!-- page
368--><a name="page368"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
368</span>his genial Christian smile?&nbsp; His collar was
perfect, so was his tie; his head immoveable, so were his
principles.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dear, dear!&rdquo; said Mrs. Bumpkin,
&ldquo;I be so glad thee be come, Mr. Prigg&mdash;here be master
takin&rsquo; on so as never was; I never see&rsquo;d anything
like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, my dear lady?&rdquo; inquired
the good man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be that loryer Prigg?&rdquo; shouted a voice from the
inner room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye, Tom, it be Mr. Prigg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, zur,&rdquo; said the voice, &ldquo;come in; I
be mighty glad to see thee.&nbsp; Why dam&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; remonstrated the diffuser of Christianity
among the Jews; &ldquo;hush!&rdquo; and his hands were softly
raised in gentle protest&mdash;albeit his head never turned so
much as a hair&rsquo;s breadth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us be calm, my
dear sir, let us be calm.&nbsp; We win by being calm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, we winned the lawsuit; didn&rsquo;t us,
sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that thee did, Tom!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Bumpkin,
delighted at this momentary gleam of gladness in her
husband&rsquo;s broken heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we won,&rdquo; said Mr. Prigg.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Did I ever entertain a doubt from the first about the
merits of that case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thee did not, sir,&rdquo; said Tom; &ldquo;but lookee
&rsquo;ere, sir,&rdquo; he continued, in almost a whisper,
&ldquo;I dreamt last night as we lost un; and I see thic Snooks a
sniggering as plaain as ever I see&rsquo;d anybody in my
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear sir, what matters your dream?&nbsp; We won,
sir.&nbsp; And as for Snooks&rsquo; sniggering, I am sorry to say
he is sold up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sold oop!&rdquo; exclaimed Bumpkin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sorry!
why beest thee sorry for un&mdash;beant thee sorry for
I?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 369--><a name="page369"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
369</span>&ldquo;Sorry you&rsquo;ve won, Mr. Bumpkin?&nbsp; No;
but, I&rsquo;m sorry for Snooks, because we lose our costs.&nbsp;
Oh, that Locust is the greatest dodger I ever met.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand thee, sir,&rdquo; said
Bumpkin.&nbsp; &ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye mean by not getting
costs&mdash;won&rsquo;t ur pay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear not,&rdquo; said Mr. Prigg, rubbing his
hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am surprised, too, that he should not have
waited until the rule for a new trial was argued.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the devil be the meaning o&rsquo; all this?&rdquo;
exclaimed Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, really,&rdquo; said the pious diffuser of
Christianity, &ldquo;we must exercise patience; we may get more
damages if there should be another trial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This be trial enough,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumpkin;
&ldquo;and after all it were a trumpery case about a
pig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so, quite so,&rdquo; said the lawyer, rubbing his
hands; &ldquo;but you see, my dear sir, it&rsquo;s not so much
the pig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumpkin, &ldquo;it beant so
much th&rsquo; pig; it be the hoarses moore, and the hayricks,
and the whate, and&mdash;where be all my fowls and
dooks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fowls&mdash;quite so!&nbsp; Let me see,&rdquo; said
the meditative man, pressing the head of his gold pencil-case
against his forehead, &ldquo;the fowls&mdash;let me see&mdash;oh,
I know, they did the pleadings&mdash;so they did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And thic sow o&rsquo; mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes; I think she made an affidavit, if I remember
rightly.&nbsp; Yes, yes&mdash;and the bacon,&rdquo; said he,
elevating his left hand, &ldquo;six flitches I think there were;
they used to be in this very room&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, sure did ur,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumpkin.</p>
<p><!-- page 370--><a name="page370"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
370</span>&ldquo;Well I remember; they made a very splendid
affidavit too: I have a note of all of them in my
memory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What coomed o&rsquo; the cows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cows?&nbsp; Yes&mdash;I have it&mdash;our leading
counsel had them; and the calf, if I remember rightly, went to
the junior.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Who had the cheeses?&rdquo; inquired Mr.
Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheeses!&rdquo; said the good man.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,
yes, the cheeses; they went in refreshers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the poor old donkey?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, where be Jock?&rdquo; said Mr. Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Went for the opinion,&rdquo; answered the lawyer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where be thic bull o&rsquo; mine?&rdquo; said
Tom.&nbsp; &ldquo;He wur the finest bull in all thic county,
woren&rsquo;t he, Nancy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Bumpkin, &ldquo;and ur
follered I about, Tom, jist like a Christian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So ur did, Nancy.&nbsp; Dost thee mind, when ur got
through thic gap into Squire Stucky&rsquo;s meadow, &rsquo;mong
the cows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, Tom; and thee went and whistled un; but ur
wouldn&rsquo;t come for thy whistlin; and Joe, poor Joe! went and
got a great stick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There I mind un,&rdquo; said Bumpkin; &ldquo;what
coomed of un, Master Prigg?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; said Mr. Prigg; &ldquo;quite so; let
me see.&rdquo;&nbsp; And again the gold pencil-case was pressed
against his respectable forehead in placid cogitation.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, that bull argued the appeal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hem!&rdquo; said Mr. Bumpkin; &ldquo;argied appeal, did
ur?&nbsp; Well, I tell ee what, Master Prigg, if that air bull
&rsquo;ad knowed what I knows now, he&rsquo;d a gi&rsquo;en them
jusseses a bit o&rsquo; his mind, and thee too.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 371--><a name="page371"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
371</span>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; said Mr. Prigg; &ldquo;you
entirely mis-apprehend&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, lookee &rsquo;ere,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;it
beant no use to mince matters wi&rsquo; ee.&nbsp; What I wants to
know is as this; I winned my case&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; said Prigg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And &rsquo;ow be it then that all my sheep and things
be took off the farm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; said Mr. Prigg, in the tone of an
injured man; &ldquo;I think, of all men, clients are the most
ungrateful.&nbsp; I have worked night and day to serve you; I
have sacrificed my pleasures, which I do not reckon&mdash;my home
comforts&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who be thic feller that steals my corn an&rsquo;
hay, and pigs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, Mr. Bumpkin, this is language which I did not
expect from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But &rsquo;ow comes my farm stripped, Maister Prigg?
tell I thic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you have given a bill of sale, Mr.
Bumpkin.&nbsp; You are aware that a lawsuit cannot be carried on
without means, and you should have calculated the cost before
going to war.&nbsp; I think there is Scripture authority for
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then have this Skinalive feller the right to take
un?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I presume so,&rdquo; said Prigg; &ldquo;I know
he&rsquo;s a most respectable man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A friend o&rsquo; thine, I s&rsquo;poase?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Prigg, hesitating, &ldquo;I may even
go so far as to say that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I be gwine so fur as to say thee be a damned
rogue!&rdquo; said Mr. Bumpkin, rising, and thumping the table
with great vehemence.</p>
<p><!-- page 372--><a name="page372"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
372</span>You might have knocked Mr. Prigg down with a feather,
certainly with a bludgeon; such a shock he had never received at
the hands of a client in the whole course of his professional
experience.&nbsp; He rose and drew from his pocket an envelope, a
very large official-looking envelope, such as no man twice in his
life would like to see, even if he could be said to enjoy the
prospect once.</p>
<p>It is not usual for respectable solicitors to carry about
their bills of costs in their pockets, and why Mr. Prigg should
have done so on this occasion I am not aware.&nbsp; I merely saw
in my dream that he did so.&nbsp; There was not a change in his
countenance; his piety was intact; there was not even a suffusion
of colour.&nbsp; Placid, sweet-tempered, and urbane, as a
Christian should be, he looked pityingly towards the hot and
irascible Bumpkin, as though he should say, &ldquo;You have
smitten me on this cheek, now smite me on that!&rdquo; and placed
the great envelope on the table before the ungrateful man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What be thic?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A list of my services, sir,&rdquo; said Prigg, meekly:
&ldquo;You will see there, ungrateful man, the sacrifices I have
made on your behalf; the journeyings oft; the hunger, and, I may
say, thirst; the perils of robbers, the perils amongst false
friends, the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doant understand, sir,&rdquo; said Bumpkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because darkness hath blinded your eyes,&rdquo; said
the pious lawyer; &ldquo;but I leave you, Mr. Bumpkin, and I will
ask you, since you no longer repose confidence in my judgment and
integrity, to obtain the services of some other professional
gentleman, who will conduct your case with more zeal and fidelity
than you think I have shown; I who have carried your cause to a
triumphant issue; <!-- page 373--><a name="page373"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 373</span>and may be said to have established
the grand principle that an Englishman&rsquo;s house is his
castle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with this the good man, evidently affected by deep
emotion, shook hands silently with Mrs. Bumpkin, and disappeared
for ever from my view.</p>
<p>Never in any dream have I beheld that man again.&nbsp; Never,
surely, under any form of humanity have so many virtues been
concealed.&nbsp; I have looked for him in daily life, about the
Courts of Justice and in the political arena, but his equal for
simplicity of character, for unaffected piety, and purity of
motive, have I never discovered, although I have seen many, who,
without his talents, have vainly endeavoured to emulate his
virtues.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bumpkin examined the document he had left, and found a
most righteous statement of the services rendered by this great
and good man; which, after giving credit to Mr. Bumpkin for cash
received from Mr. Skinalive, Mr. Prigg&rsquo;s friend, of seven
hundred and twenty-two pounds, six shillings and
eightpence-half-penny, left a balance due to Honest Lawyer Prigg
of three hundred and twenty-eight pounds, seven shillings and
threepence,&mdash;subject, of course, to be reduced on
taxation.</p>
<h2><!-- page 375--><a name="page375"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 375</span>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Farewell.</p>
<p>The last chapter of a book must always possess a special and
melancholy interest for the author.&nbsp; He gives his words
reluctantly, almost grudgingly, like one who is spending his last
coins and will soon be left penniless upon the world.&nbsp; Or
like one who is passing his last moments at the house of a friend
whom he may see no more for ever.&nbsp; The author is taking
farewell of his characters and his readers, and therefore his
regret is twofold; added to which is the doubt as to whether,
judged by the severe standard of Public Opinion, he has been
faithful to both.&nbsp; Thought is large, and may fill the world,
permeating every class and every section of society; it may be
circumscribed, and operate only upon some infinitesimal
proportion of mankind: but whether great or small, for good or
evil, it is published, and a corresponding responsibility
devolves upon the writer.&nbsp; I record my dream faithfully, and
am therefore exonerated, in my conscience, from responsibility in
its effect.</p>
<p>How shall I describe the closing scene of this eventful
story?&nbsp; I will imagine nothing; I will exaggerate nothing;
for, during the whole progress of the story, it has been my
constant care not to give the most captious critic the
opportunity of saying that I have exaggerated a single
incident.&nbsp; I will relate faithfully what I saw in <!-- page
376--><a name="page376"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 376</span>my
dream, and that only; diminishing nothing, and adding
nothing.</p>
<p>In my waking moments my wife said it was very wrong of Mr.
Bumpkin, after all that Mr. Prigg had done for him, to be so
rude.&nbsp; I agreed that it was: but said, great allowance must
be made for Mr. Bumpkin&rsquo;s want of education.&nbsp; Then
said my wife, &ldquo;Will not some shallow-minded persons say
that your story attacks the administration of
justice?&rdquo;&nbsp; To which I replied that it did not matter
what shallow-minded persons said, but that in fact I had in no
way attacked the administration of justice; nor had I in the
least degree reflected on the great body of respectable
solicitors who had in their hands the interests of the country,
and faithfully discharged their duties.&nbsp; And then I stood
up, and putting forth my hand in imitation of Pitt&rsquo;s statue
in the corridor of the House of Commons, I said, &ldquo;Justice
is Divine, not Human; and you cannot detract from anything that
is Divine, any more than you can lessen the brilliancy of the
sun.&nbsp; You may obscure its splendour to mortal eyes, but its
effulgence is the same.&nbsp; Man may so ostensibly assert his
own dignity, or the dignity of a perishable system, that it may
temporarily veil the beauty of a Divine attribute; but Justice
must still remain the untarnished glory of Divine wisdom.&nbsp;
It is not the pomp of position or the majesty of office that
imparts dignity to Justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here, exhausted with my effort, and with my wife&rsquo;s
applause ringing in my ears, I fell asleep again, and dreamed
that I saw Bumpkin sadly wandering about the old farm; his
faithful wife following, and never for one moment ceasing to
cheer him up.&nbsp; It was a fine bright morning in October as
they wandered <!-- page 377--><a name="page377"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 377</span>forth.&nbsp; There wasn&rsquo;t a
living thing about the farm except the birds, and even they
seemed sad in their twittering.&nbsp; Could it be possible that
they knew of poor Bumpkin&rsquo;s miserable condition?</p>
<p>There was an old jackdaw that certainly did; for he hopped and
hopped along after the master with the saddest expression I ever
saw bird wear.&nbsp; But the master took no notice.&nbsp; On and
on he wandered, seemingly unconscious of the presence even of his
wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Tom, where beest thee
gwine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bumpkin started; turned round, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nancy! what, be it thee, lassie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, Tom, sure enough it be I.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s cheer
up, Tom.&nbsp; If the worst come to the worst&mdash;we can but
goo to Union.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wust have come to th&rsquo; wust, Nancy; we be
ruined!&nbsp; Look at this &rsquo;ere farm&mdash;all be
bare&mdash;all be lost, Nancy.&nbsp; Hark how silent it all
be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, Tom; never mind.&nbsp; I wish Joe wur
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! Joe, yes.&nbsp; I wonder where Joe be; praps he be
out here in th&rsquo; six akre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, Tom, he be gwine for a sojer; but I&rsquo;ve a
mind he&rsquo;ll come back.&nbsp; And who knows, we may be
&rsquo;appy yet!&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve worked hard, Tom, together
these five-and-thirty year, and sure we can trudge on t&rsquo;
th&rsquo; end.&nbsp; Come, let&rsquo;s goo in and ave some
breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Tom kept on walking and looking round the fields after his
old manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ll ave wuts here,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So ur will, Tom, but let&rsquo;s have breakfast
fust.&nbsp; Come, lad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They wandered still through the quiet fields, and the old
man&rsquo;s mind seemed giving way.&nbsp; But I saw that <!--
page 378--><a name="page378"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
378</span>Mrs. Bumpkin kept up with him and cheered him whenever
she could put in a word of comfort, cold and hopeless as it
was.&nbsp; And so the day was spent, and the night came, and they
entered their home for the last time.&nbsp; It was a terribly sad
night; but the Vicar came and sat up late with the old people,
and talked to them and read and cried with them, until at last
Tom said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I zee it, sir, thee hast showed I; thank God for thy
words.&nbsp; Yes, yes, we maun leave t&rsquo; morrer, and
we&rsquo;ll call on thee, and maybe thou&rsquo;lt goo to
th&rsquo; Squire wi&rsquo; us and explaain to un how we
can&rsquo;t pay our rent, and may be th&rsquo; Squire&rsquo;ll
let I work un out.&nbsp; If we could only work un out, I&rsquo;d
be &rsquo;appy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, Tom,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bumpkin, &ldquo;an I&rsquo;ll
work too; thee knows that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thee wast allays a good wife, Nancy; and I&rsquo;ll
allays say&rsquo;t, come what wooll.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Vicar, &ldquo;to-morrow we will
go&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want un to forgive I th&rsquo;
rent,&rdquo; said Tom; &ldquo;only to gie us time, and Nancy and
I&rsquo;ll work un out.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so it was arranged that
the next morning the old home was to be left for ever.&nbsp; It
was no longer home, for every article of furniture, every tool,
every scrap that was of any value had been ruthlessly seized by
the heartless money-lender whom the Law permitted to rob under
the name of a bill of sale.&nbsp; The man was in possession to
take away their bed and the few other articles that were left for
their accommodation till the morrow.</p>
<p>And on the morrow I saw the last of poor Bumpkin that I shall
ever see.&nbsp; In the beautiful sunshine of that October
morning, just by the old oak, he was leaning over the gate
looking his last at the dear old fields and the old farm-house
where so many happy years had been <!-- page 379--><a
name="page379"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
379</span>spent.&nbsp; By his side was his wife, with her hand
shading her eyes; the old dog was between them, looking into the
face now of Tom and then of his wife.&nbsp; Mr. Bumpkin&rsquo;s
arms were resting on the gate, and his old ash stick that he used
to walk with over the fields was in his hand.&nbsp; They stood
there for a long, long time as though they could never leave
it.&nbsp; And I saw the tears trickle down the old man&rsquo;s
face as Mrs. Bumpkin, letting fall the corner of her apron, which
she had held to her eyes, and placing her arm through his, said
in a faltering voice:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Tom, we must goo.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="poetry">Tom Bumpkin was a thriving man,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As all the world could see;<br />
In forty years he&rsquo;d raised himself<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From direst poverty.</p>
<p class="poetry">And now he rented from the Squir<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some acres, near a score;<br />
Some people said &rsquo;twas twenty-five,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And some that it was more.</p>
<p class="poetry">He had a sow of rare brave breed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And nine good pigs had he;<br />
A cow and calf, a rick of hay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And horses he had three.</p>
<p class="poetry">And Mrs. Bumpkin had a bull,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The finest creature out;<br />
&ldquo;And, like a Christian,&rdquo; so she said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;It follered her about.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">So Bumpkin was a thriving man,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As all the world could see;<br />
A self-made man, but yet not made<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of scholarship was he.</p>
<p class="poetry">With neighbour Snooks he dealings had<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; About his latest farrow;<br />
Snooks said he&rsquo;d bought a pig, and so,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To prove it, brought his barrow.</p>
<p class="poetry">Tom said, &ldquo;It wur to be two
crowns;&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Snooks said, &ldquo;Twur nine-and-six;&rdquo;<br />
Then Tom observed, &ldquo;You doan&rsquo;t &rsquo;ave me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wi none o&rsquo; them there tricks.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">So there was battle; Lawyer Prigg<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was told this tale of woe;<br />
The Lawyer rubbed his bony hands<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And said, &ldquo;I see; quite so!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry"><!-- page 382--><a name="page382"></a><span

&ldquo;Now mak un pay vor&rsquo;t, mak un pay;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It beant so much th&rsquo; pig.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;No, no, it&rsquo;s not so much the
pig,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That were a matter small;<br />
Indeed, good Bumpkin, we may say<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not the pig at all!</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more the <i>principle</i>
involved,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The rights of man, you see&rdquo;&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; quoth Tom; &ldquo;the devil&rsquo;s

&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;F I beant as good as he.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">There never was a man more prompt<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or swift to strike a blow:<br />
Give but the word, and Charger Prigg<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was down upon the foe.</p>
<p class="poetry">The <span class="smcap">Letter</span>, <span

<p class="poetry">Then <span class="smcap">Interrogatories</span>
flew<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Without procrastination:<br />
As when the ambushed outposts give<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A deadly salutation.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now Snooks&rsquo;s lawyer was a man<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To wrong would never pander;<br />
And like a high-souled Pleader drew<br />

<p class="poetry">And then with cautious skill behind<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The legal outworks clambers;<br />
Until dislodged, he held his own<br />

He drained the well, and yet withal<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The noble Prigg was dry.</p>
<p class="poetry">With plaintive look would move a stone,<br />

Who rubbed his hands and said, &ldquo;You see,<br />

<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Noa, noa, it be th&rsquo; horses

<p class="poetry">The Lawyer said, &ldquo;Quite so, quite
so!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Looked wise, and wisely grinned;<br />
For Tom was like a ship becalmed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He stopped for want of wind.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Prigg with
gravity<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Would almost make you laugh,<br />

uncertain.&nbsp; I have peeped at it, and think if it reaches
maturity it will help the rich litigant very much; and, if it
abolishes trial by jury, as it threatens, we shall be, in time to

the future <i>might</i> be between servility and a prison; and I
sincerely believe that if trial by jury should be abolished, this
country would not be safe to live in.&nbsp; Much <i>mending</i>,

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
